<p class="chapblock">Rock inscriptions&mdash;Marks on wood&mdash;Quipus&mdash;Wampum&mdash;Modern
ideographs&mdash;Indian palm leaf books&mdash;Ideographs and alphabets&mdash;Diptychs.</p>

<p>The idea of making records by means of marks cut on
stone or wood did not originate in any one place, for signs
of it are found more or less all over the world wherever
primitive man has existed. It was not until a comparatively
late period that the various kinds of record keeping were
unified after a fashion and true writing evolved itself out
of the chaos.</p>

<p>There are some forms of record keeping that have been
largely used by the human race which, as far as we can at
present tell, have not influenced our present form of book
except negatively; but indirectly they may still have done
so in some manner that we cannot distinguish.</p>

<p>Mankind is naturally imitative, and among his early
efforts in this direction are the scratchings on bones and
antlers. They comprise outlines of deer, mammoths, reindeer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
seals, bears, horses and other animals. Several instances
of these early drawings have been found in the caves of the
Dordogne in France. These, however, are not records, they
are only pictures of what the artist saw, and a large proportion
of rock and stone markings come into the same category.
But there is no doubt that many of the latter are intended
to commemorate certain events; they show groupings of
marks, animals and men in positions and attitudes which are
clearly intended to mean something, and now and then it has
been possible to make a good guess at their interpretation.</p>

<p>The earliest marks made by man that still exist are to be
found among the rock markings or carvings, as these are
often in protected places where the weather has not worn
them away. Prehistoric caves and tombs are prolific in
such treasures, and the marks, ideographs or hieroglyphics
are always of the greatest interest. There seems to be
some analogy between the great megalithic temples like
that on Salisbury Plain and many of the rock inscriptions,
but little is at present known on this point.</p>

<p>Cup and ring markings on rocks or stones are among the
most remarkable of rock inscriptions because they are not
isolated as to their design. From Ireland to India these
marks are found possessing the same radical forms, and it is
impossible to avoid the conclusion that they have been
made by tribes of men who had some thought or idea in
common. What this idea was is still a disputed point
among archæologists.</p>

<p>Cup and ring markings are held by some authorities to be
astronomical, sun signs, but these speculations, especially in
Scandinavian examples, soon land us in pure symbolism,
ring crosses, swastikas, triskeles and the rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Apart from these, marks are found in the British Isles and
in India particularly through which a dominant idea is
clearly present. It seems likely that some common religious
symbolism is really the key to the mystery, and this belief,
disavowed by Sir J. Simpson, is strongly held by Col.
J. H. Rivett-Carnac, as well as by many others. By these
archæologists the cup and ring markings are considered to
be the ideographic expressions of one of the primitive
religions of the world which was very widely spread, and the
remains of which exist in India
at the present day.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>&mdash;Stone cist with ring
marks. Found at Coilsford in Ayrshire.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But even admitting the possibility
of this interpretation,
there are still many points left
unexplained. For instance, in
the drawing, it will be seen
that the cups with their rings
are cunningly attached to each
other, and the whole design
appears as if it “means something.” No doubt some
day further light will be thrown upon this curious form
of record.</p>

<p>The Assyrian and Babylonian sculptures both in the round
and in bas-reliefs are commonly covered with cuneiform
inscriptions, and these are also plentifully found inscribed
on stone stelæ and bronze figurines. The famous Rosetta
stone is a familiar example of a tri-lingual inscription that
will probably last as long as the world lasts. It is now in
the British Museum, and bears an inscription in Hieroglyphic,
Demotic and Greek. The Greek being understood,
it gave at once the key to the interpretation of the Hieroglyphic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
The date of the cutting of this stone is about the
beginning of the second century before the birth of Christ.
An earlier stone of a similar kind is known as the tablet of
Sen; it contains a decree of the priests at Canopus in
honour of Ptolemy Evergetes I. It was made in <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 238,
but has not yet got to England.</p>

<p>The ten commandments were engraved on stone, and
instances of inscriptions on small stones are very
numerous. From Egypt to North America amulets bearing
mystical sentences have been
commonly made. Familiar to
most of us are the turquoises
engraved with Arabic words
run in with gold, and the
curious “Garuda” and other
stones, with magical inscriptions
and credited with magical
powers, have been common in
the East from time immemorial.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;Garuda amulet.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In India inscriptions, holy names, invocations and
quotations are cut on small flat pieces of jasper, agate,
onyx, carnelian, amethyst, hematite, jade, and materials of
less value like coral or glass, some of the old and some new.
Musulman amulets of similar kinds are also sometimes found
on gold, silver, iron, and even on small bricks of baked clay.</p>

<p>Many of these amulets have pierced ears for suspension,
and they were worn as jewellery on the neck or ears or sewn
on girdles. They were also fixed on weapons of war and
horse furniture. Some of the stones are engraved in
reverse so as to make impressions. These are seal stones,
but the greater number are engraved simply so as to read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
straightforwardly. They are in Arabic, Persian, and rarely
Turkish.</p>

<p>Greek and Roman cameos and intaglios are often found
bearing short inscriptions as well as the names of their
engravers. Even the diamond has not escaped, but
inscriptions on this stone are very rare because of the
difficulty of engraving it. Numbers of inscriptions, names
and mottoes can be found on ring stones of all times as well
as on real stones.</p>

<p>Curious Chinese books are made of leaves of jade, and in
these inscriptions are cut in the decorative Chinese
character, run in with gold.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the forms of letters have always
been much influenced by the manner in which they could
be most easily made. It is easier to cut a square form of
letter on stone than a cursive form, so we find that the
majority of rock or stone inscriptions favour the square
form rather than the rounded form of letter. We derive
our angular forms of letters from the distant past, but the
rounded forms are adapted from the later times of papyrus
or vellum, when reed or pen writing was understood.</p>

<p>Writings on metal have been made from time to time, but
never very largely. In India inscribed plaques of bronze,
kept together by metal rings, have been often used.
Tablets of lead are recorded as having been used by ancient
peoples, and Oriental as well as European talismanic
formulæ have been engraved on small plates of silver,
bronze, brass or lead, the letters being now and then damascened
with gold and silver. In ancient Rome name-brands
were cut in bronze, and impressions could have been
printed from them. They were beautifully cut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>The Nicene creed was cut in silver by order of Pope
Leo III., and in the East strips of metal have constantly
been substituted for the long thin pieces of
palm leaf which formed the normal books. The metal
leaves are found of gold, silver, or gilded copper particularly.
The plates are quite thin, and the characters
upon them are generally engraved, but sometimes they are
chased with tracer and hammer. Such records are not
only very permanent but they are also very decorative.
The modern engraving of inscriptions on metal has mainly
found refuge in monumental brasses, and in this case the
letterings are usually run
in with some pigment.</p>

</div>

<p>Another primitive form
of record is found in the
case of notches cut in
wood. A savage warrior
of a literary turn of mind
would naturally wish to keep some record of the
number of his enemies that he had killed and perhaps
eaten, and an obvious way of doing this would be to cut or
scratch marks on his war club. Such records would, no
doubt, become customary among war-like tribes. The
handles of war axes or spears would offer excellent ground
for such marks, and presently, especially in peace times,
similar marks may well have kept tallies of the numbers of
game killed.</p>

<p>From such personal notes the transition to others of wider
interest is not difficult, and so we find the notches used,
on bits of wood or sticks, for almanacks and calendars.</p>

<p>Ogham and Runic inscriptions follow the ancient idea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
notches cut along an angular edge, and these notches and
rods are the very distant ancestors of
our modern types of metal; the German
word “Buchstab,” meaning type, is
etymologically “a wooden rod.”</p>

<p>In Denmark and Sweden in ancient
times almanacks were cut on flat pieces
of metal, bone, horn, box, fir or oak.
The majority of them are of wood, but the
other materials were sometimes used.
They are variously known as Rune
staves or stocks, Prime staves, Messe dag
staves or Brim stocks, and they are
generally hinged along one side by cords
run through holes, several slabs being
thus fastened together. Wooden calendars
are also often found among the
records kept by primitive peoples; they
have been found in Sumatra and in
many other places.</p>

<p>Similar almanacks were used by our
Saxon ancestors, who no doubt borrowed
the idea from the Scandinavians. One
side was kept for the summer and the
other for the winter, and notches for the
days were made across the edges.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>&mdash;Staffordshire clog almanack.</p></div>
</div>

<p>During the reign of Queen Elizabeth
a modification of the Scandinavian Rune
staves was largely used in England,
chiefly in Staffordshire, but not exclusively. These are
known as “clog almanacks,” and Dr. Plott says that “Clogg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
may mean Logg, or that they are like the cloggs with which
we restrain our doggs.”</p>

<p>English clog almanacks are squared pieces of wood,
measuring from about two feet to nine or ten inches in
length, and the larger ones are sometimes as much as three
inches square. They are notched along the angles, small
notches without ornamentation indicating week days, big
notches stand for Sundays, and Saints days have all kinds
of ornamental flourishes, which now and then show familiar
forms such as Saint Catherine’s wheel and Saint Lawrence’s
gridiron.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span>&mdash;Modern hop-tally of wood.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Some of the clogs show a hole at the lower end, evidently
so that they could
stand upright upon a
peg, others, and these
are the most usual,
have a flat pierced
handle so that they can be suspended by a loop. They were
commonly kept in churches. Details of several well known
examples of clog almanacks will be found figured in <cite>The
Reliquary</cite> for January, 1865, in illustration of an excellent
article on the subject by Mr. John Harland. Exchequer and
other wooden tallies were common in England in the 14th
century, and in modern days a certain survival of them exists
in the form of hop-tallies. These are two strips of wood
which fit closely together with a tongue, and when in contact
notches are made across the two edges in apposition, so
that when the two pieces are apart, neither party can falsify
the notches without it being at once apparent when the
slips are finally brought together. The principle is exactly
the same as that utilised in the old legal “indentures,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
by virtue of which a piece of vellum was cut in two
by an indentured, or toothed line, and if these did not
exactly fit whenever they were brought together it became
evident that they had been tampered with. In parts of
France tallies like these are still used by bakers.</p>

<p>Wooden tallies are also found among the inhabitants of
Torres Straits, where they use them made of short sticks
tied together at their tops.</p>

<p>Curious inscriptions, as yet undecipherable, have been
found at Easter Island; they are cut in thick slabs of wood
and are ideographic.</p>

<p>Bones have been from very early times the recipients of
men’s marks; the earliest of these, however, were only copies
of things seen. But inscriptions and symbols were presently
scratched on them, and the blade bones of buffaloes in
North America as well as the shoulder blades of sheep used
by the Arabs are equally convenient for writing upon. In
Sumatra inscriptions are commonly cut in flat pieces of
bone. Instances of inscriptions in ivory are very numerous,
and the finest examples of these occur in the case of the Roman
consular diptychs which are described a little further on.</p>

<p>Information as to direction is still often given by means
of marks or “blazes” on trees, a survival of a primitive
method, and American lumbermen or “loggers” cut
hieroglyphic marks of ownership on their logs when they
send them down stream.</p>

<p>In times of trouble it often happens that primitive
methods of communication are resorted to, like that received
by a Cavalier from his lady love who heard that the
Roundheads were after him&mdash;she sent him a feather, and
he flew away and escaped.</p>

</div>

<p>Such symbolical messages are common enough among
savage tribes, but without some key it is almost impossible
to interpret them. They are so
various in their composition that no
useful analysis of them can be made.
On one such message from West
Africa, strung on a string of flat fibre
knotted at each end, are a bit of shell, a
bit of fur, a bean, a cylindrical stick,
a piece of leather, a mass of frog’s eggs
or something like it, a flat piece of
bark, a feather, a tooth and a shell.
In another are two pieces of flat glass
kept together with red thread, and
two teeth on each side of it, all
strung on fibre, and so on.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The Battas of Sumatra use different and probably more
elaborate messages, as they
consist of carefully cut strips
of wood, resembling the old
spillikins with which our childhood’s
days were made happy.
These strips of thin wood,
about three inches in length,
are cut into various shapes
which have no obvious collective
meaning. In one of
them is a capital model of a
little broom, accompanied apparently by a series of little
clubs and spikes. Such a message might have been
sent by an absent brave to his squaw at home, and may have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
meant that if she didn’t sweep up the wigwam before his
arrival she would experience the effect of one or other of
the clubs.</p>

<p>The Incas of Peru had a regular system of keeping
records by means of coloured pieces of string knotted in a
peculiar way.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_011.jpg" width="600" height="323" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span>&mdash;Peruvian Quipu.</p></div>
</div>

<p>These knotted records, or Quipus, had special keepers
who held office in the provinces, and the results of their
energy were forwarded annually to the capital city for
examination and preservation. The provincial keepers
were called “Quipu Camayas,” and the records they
kept were mainly statistics concerning the people of their
districts. The knots were arranged either on a strong
piece of cord or upon a stick, and formed a sort of fringe;
the word “Quipu” means a knot. According to the position
of the knot a certain number was probably indicated,
and the class of person referred to is shown by the colour
of the bit of string which represents it.</p>

<p>But it is also likely that more elaborate interpretations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
could be made by skilled interpreters of Quipus. Little
is really known as to that, but it is suggested by competent
observers that, for instance, red meant war, yellow meant
gold, white meant peace, and silver. But this is probably
guess work. The same idea has been utilised in the case of
a rare Chinese book, the leaves of which were of differently
coloured silks. Each colour was supposed to convey a
certain emotion to the student, and when he had exhausted
the emotion caused by one colour, he turned over the leaf
so as to experience the
effect of another.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.</span>&mdash;Cardinal’s hat.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The use of knots as
reminders is not quite
obsolete, as it is common
enough even now to make
a knot in one’s handkerchief,
if anything easy
is to be remembered. It
is curious if this custom
is really a survival of
the Peruvian Quipu!</p>

<p>A form of knotted record is used among several of the
tribes in the Pacific Islands, and the Jewish “Taleth,” or
scarf, has fringes which imply certain facts.</p>

<p>The ordinary rosary with its ten beads for Ave Maria’s
and single ones for Pater Nosters has also something in
common with knots, and possibly the abacus of the Greeks
and the Chinese may have a similar origin. But probably
these last are only used as aids in mathematical
calculations.</p>

<p>Something analogous to the Peruvian knots is to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
found in the tasselled and knotted fringes which adorn the
ceremonial hats of dignitaries in the Romish church.</p>

<p>The hats themselves are always of the same shape,
round shallow crowns with broad brims. The fringes,
however, differ in size and colour according to the rank of
the wearer. The master cord is drawn through the brim
of the hat at its inner edge, at a point over each ear, and
kept in place by a large ornamental knot on the outside.</p>

<p>The tassels start from one, and from this two others
depend, and from these three, and so on, one more in each
row. An abbot wears a black hat with six green tassels on
each side; a
bishop wears a
green hat with
six green tassels
on each side on
a gold cord; an
archbishop has a
violet hat with
ten violet tassels
on each side on a gold cord, and a cardinal has a red hat
with fifteen red tassels on a gold cord, depending on each
side.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span>&mdash;Portion of North American wampum
belt.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The wampum belts of North America were primarily
used as money, but they were also made sometimes in such
a way that they formed historical records.</p>

<p>The true “Six Nation” wampum belts were made of
little white and purple cylinders of shell very laboriously
cut, and the purple ones very difficult to get. “Wampum”
means white, and there is generally a preponderance of this
colour. The short beads are strung upon long threads or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
strips of leather, and the design shows sometimes in
purple on a white ground and sometimes in white on a
purple ground.</p>

<p>The designs are sometimes easy to decipher, like the belt
which typifies the Iroquois League, showing the one heart
of the ruling nation in the centre, and the allied nations,
each shown by a square, united together in one bond.</p>

<p>A very fine and interesting wampum belt was given as a
record of friendship to William Penn at the Great Treaty in
1682, by the Sachems of the Lenni Lenape. It is now preserved
by the Historical Society at Philadelphia. It is made
of eighteen rows of white and purple cylindrical shell beads,
the ground white and the designs in purple. The beads are
laced upon nineteen parallel “horizontal” strips of leather
by means of thinner strips running vertically across them
and brought twice through each bead, one running being
above the horizontal strip and the other below it. It is a
curious way of stringing beads, and was practised in
England some sixty or seventy years ago in the making of
small bead ribbons. In the centre of the belt is a
conventional figure of Penn shaking hands with the chief
Sachem.</p>

<p>Many of the wampum belts seem to have only geometrical
designs upon them, but doubtless, without exception,
these fine white and purple shell belts, cut with infinite
patience and skill, and put together with the greatest care,
always have some meaning. The Iroquois could, until
recently, interpret them at once, but now they are less able
to understand the work of their ancestors.</p>

<p>There are plenty of imitation wampum belts, usually
made of small shells or ordinary beads. The genuine belts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
are flat and strong, and the little shell cylinders nearly all
of the same size. The imitations are much more irregularly
and carelessly made, and they are often without any colour
but white.</p>

<p>A common form of book in Oriental countries consists of
long narrow strips of palm leaf, kept together by two
strings run through holes near each end. The writing
upon the leaves is carried right along the length of each
leaf in successive lines, and is scratched in, and usually
strengthened by means of lamp black rubbed over it so as
to stick in the scratches.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_015.jpg" width="300" height="78" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span>&mdash;Oriental palm-leaf
book.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This form of book rests by itself. Apparently it has never
altered materially, neither has
it in any way affected the production
of the book as we know
it. The palm leaves are brittle,
they are troublesome to turn
over, and are likely to split and
break where the cord touches them. But the leaves
are frequently made of stronger materials than palm leaf,
some of them being of gold, silver, or gilded copper,
and in these cases the lettering is engraved or punched.
Others are written on plates of ivory, the letters being
gilded, others again on plates of lacquer with letters inlaid
with mother-of-pearl; indeed, the variety is large.</p>

<p>The leaves are always enclosed between two covers of
stronger make but of the same shape, and these covers are
often very elaborately ornamented. Some of them have
exquisite carved work and inlaid work and others are
painted. In the case of Indian examples they are often
messed over with red stains. When this is found the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
manuscript has belonged to some shrine, and worshippers
have daubed it with rice and red paint as a sort of peace
offering. The strings with which the leaves are bound
together are also sometimes handsomely ornamented.</p>

<p>Ancient rock inscriptions, tallies, quipus and wampums
are all more or less ideographic, and among trade signs
there are still many ideographs in common use, some of
them of considerable antiquity. There are the three golden
balls of the pawnbroker, which mean that money can be
borrowed there. They are derived from the coat of arms of
the Medici of Lombardy. The Lombards were mediæval
bankers and money lenders, and for their badge they took
three of the golden balls, or pills, out of the Medici coat.</p>

<p>These balls varied in number and colour, they were sometimes
red, and sometimes blue, and three blue balls upon a
white ground was one of the mediæval signs used by money
lenders, but the three golden balls have proved more
lasting.</p>

<p>Another old ideograph is the white barber’s pole, with its
red spiral, the image of the red bandage used to tie up an
arm which had just been bled. It was originally the mark
of a barber surgeon, but the barber still uses it although he
no longer bleeds his clients. An old sign for a barber is
also a shaving dish. This is oftener seen on the continent
than it is here.</p>

<p>The embowed arm holding a hammer is an old sign of
a gold beater, and is generally itself gilded. It is clearly
an ideograph, as is also the fishing rod with a golden fish,
which is a usual sign over a fishing tackle maker’s shop. A
modern instance of the same kind is a gilded ham which is
not uncommonly seen over provision shops, quite a modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
sign. The rapidly disappearing Highlander taking snuff is
another modern ideograph. There are plenty more of such
signs, most of which tell their story directly and simply,
while others, the older ones particularly, may at first seem
arbitrary, but often a little examination will reveal a simple
origin.</p>

<p>The curious hieroglyphics still used by gypsies are no
doubt derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics, and although
most of them have changed considerably, a certain resemblance
in some of the forms can still be traced.</p>

<p>Ideograms are still used in North America in out of the
way places. A common mark for a cheese is a circle, and
this sign was found opposite a farmer’s name, but he had
never had one. He did, however, owe for a grindstone,
and the draughtsman clerk had forgotten to put in the
centre dot which would have marked the difference
between the stone and the edible.</p>

<p>In common use more or less all over the civilised world
is the pointing hand, meaning either “Look there” or
“This way.”</p>

<p>Some signs are also ideographic in character; among these
are certain of the deaf and dumb signs, and also some of
the arm signals used in the navy. In the army some of
the bugle calls imitate as far as possible the sounds to
which they refer. For instance, the “prepare for cavalry”
has some resemblance to horses galloping.</p>

<p>Ideographs used in written languages soon change in
character. No longer do they mean simply what they portray,
but the sound of its name, and then by degrees they represented
the first syllable, and eventually only the first letter
of its name. These changes of meaning are accompanied by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
changes of form, and it is very curious to trace how an
apparently arbitrary letter form is really only the survival of
the main lines of an ancient ideogram. There are several
most interesting instances of these changes given by Dr.
Isaac Taylor in his classic “History of the Alphabet,” as well
as by other writers on the subject, particularly Sir E. Maunde
Thompson and Mr. Falconer Madan.</p>

<p>Egyptian inscriptions show both ideographs, hieroglyphics
and alphabetic signs, as there is usually a word spelt out
in syllables or letters, and at the end of it the complete
word shown as a little picture. The hieroglyphics altered
into a style of writing which was not so pictorial about
the nineteenth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and although alphabetical
symbols were actually used as early as 4,000 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
yet it was very many years later than this that they
became of general use. The earliest piece of hieroglyphic
known is cut upon stone on a tablet now preserved in the
Ashmolean Museum at Oxford. It is supposed to have
been made about 4,000 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and on it the name of King
Send is written alphabetically.</p>

<p>Our present alphabetic writing is by no means final, as it is
even now undergoing a remarkable change, in which neither
ideograph, hieroglyphic, nor alphabet plays any part.
Shorthand will in time supersede our comparatively
cumbrous process, and it is purely phonetic.</p>

<p>Chinese writing is still in the syllabic state, but the
Japanese, which is formed from it, has advanced many
steps towards the alphabetical stage.</p>

<p>The earliest handwriting known is that on the Papyrus
Prisse, now in Paris. It is in Egyptian hieratic writing,
and is supposed to date perhaps from about 4,000 <span class="smcap">B.C.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></span>
The hieratic is a cursive form of hieroglyphic, and was
used particularly by priests.</p>

<p>We derive our present letters “longo intervallo” from
Egyptian hieroglyphics, and the history of their evolution
is full of interest.</p>

<p>It may be well here to review rapidly how it is that we
have acquired an alphabet for printing purposes which is
clear, though not beautiful. Our present type shows two
alphabets; one, the capital letters, are of Roman origin, the
other, the small letters, are a modification of what are
called Carolingian minuscules, and both alphabets have
reached us through the Latin, Greek, Phœnician and
Semitic.</p>

<p>Up to the seventh or eighth centuries in Europe the
various styles of writing were in a mixed condition, but about
that time the different forms of letters began to arrange
themselves, and to follow distinctive lines of development
in different countries.</p>

<p>Charlemagne interested himself in the matter, and saw
that the time had arrived when something could be done
towards clearing away the many difficulties which cropped
up by reason of the different forms of letters which then
existed. He caused careful studies to be made of existing
styles so that some sort of common ground could be found.
At Tours the Emperor set up a sort of Royal Commission
to enquire into the matter, and at the head of it he placed a
learned Englishman, Alcuin of York, who was known as a
great student and was himself a calligraphist. Alcuin was
trained in the beautiful Hiberno-Saxon hand, of which so
many magnificent examples still remain&mdash;the Book of
Kells, the Gospels of Lindisfarne, and several more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>At Tours the Carolingian minuscules, which are the
direct ancestors of our small, or lower-case letters, were
developed.</p>

<p>Our capital letters have developed themselves on different
lines. They are like the ancient Roman types, which in
the twelfth century had modified themselves somewhat and
become very clear, and these forms commended themselves
to the scribes of the Renaissance period, and underwent
still more improvement in details. The early type cutters
who formed their letters directly after the shapes of letters
written by hand, soon saw that these
capitals were not only easy to cut but
were in every way the best they
could find to copy.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span>&mdash;Roman
diptych.</p></div>
</div>

<p>During some excavations at
Pompeii in 1875 a large collection
of small wax writing tablets or Pugillaria
was found. These tablets resemble
small slates; they are of wood,
and one side is slightly hollowed out
so as to receive a filling of blackened wax. Generally two
of the tablets were hinged together, hence their name of
diptychs, but sometimes they were in threes or even more,
like a tail or “Caudex,” from which it is said we derive our
word Codex. Diptychs are the direct prototypes of our
modern books.</p>

<p>The writing was marked on the wax by means of a style
in the same way that writing was formerly done in England
on the curious sand tables. These styles are usually
of iron, sometimes inlaid with brass, but they were also
made of bronze, brass, wood or bone. They always have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
one end pointed to write with and the other flat to erase
with. A space was often left in the thickness of the
wooden edge of a diptych to keep the style in. The
erasing in the case of the diptych was effected by rubbing
the flat end of the style over it, and in the case of the sand
writing-tablet by a plasterer’s level or a good shake.
Sand tablets have been used up to quite recent times in
elementary schools. But the sand writing was always
temporary, whereas the wax writing is very lasting, one of
those found at Pompeii bearing the date <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 55. It records
a payment to Umbricia Januaria, and is the earliest Latin
manuscript known.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span>&mdash;Roman diptych stylus.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Diptychs of similar form were widely used. They have
been found in Egypt, and in England&mdash;remains of the
Roman occupation&mdash;together with numbers of the styles
used for writing with.</p>

<p>Diptychs were kept together at the back by means of metal
rings or thongs of leather, run through holes made in the
wood, so that they are true prototypes of our modern books
both as to form and manner of keeping together, the
“stabbed” form of binding, that is to say, threads or bands
or wires run through holes pierced along the back edge of
the sections of a book, having been in continual use ever
since rolls were first turned into books.</p>

<p>When the diptychs were used as private letters they
were further fastened with a tie or clasp in front, and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
tie was often sealed with the sender’s signet in wax or
clay.</p>

<p>The Pompeian and all the other small wooden diptychs
are unornamented, but at a later
period, particularly from the second
to the seventh century, Roman
diptychs became of much importance
and were often decoratively
treated, being made of ivory and
elaborately carved.</p>

<p>Labarte, Gori, Westwood and
Maskell have all written valuable
works concerning these ornamental
diptychs, and specimens of more or
less excellence can be found in most
museums that have any collection
of carvings in ivory. The earlier
examples are the best; later specimens
rapidly decline in art value,
although they are always of great
historical interest.</p>

<p>One leaf of one of the finest diptychs
in existence is fortunately in
the British Museum; it shows a full-length
figure of an archangel with
globe, cross and long-staff, and is
supposed to have been made in the third or fourth
century. A curious point about this leaf is its unusual
size, about 16 by 6 inches, and it is said that such a piece
could not be cut from any known elephant tusk. It is
possibly mammoth ivory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>For a long time the supreme power at Rome was vested
in the consuls who held office for one year. Naturally
anyone elected to this high position was anxious to inform
everyone holding any high place or office of his accession
to the dignity, and the usual
way of doing this was to send
round diptychs of ivory announcing
the event, as well
as subsequent ones concerning
any other important matters
which might occur during the
consulate.</p>

</div>

<p>Not only was the communication
inscribed upon the wax,
all of which is now gone, but
the outside ivory was carved
with invaluable portraits,
scenes and inscriptions. By
examining these carvings we
can frequently ascertain who
was the consul that issued
them, and often enough we
can find his portrait carefully
drawn. In one of the many
excavations made in the
Forum at Rome, tablets containing a list of Roman consuls
were found, and these serve as an official check upon our
interpretation of the records existing upon the consular
diptychs.</p>

<p>Consular diptychs were generally larger than the
wooden pugillaria, which were always small. Ivory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
diptychs are rarely less than six or seven inches in
length.</p>

<p>The privilege of giving away finely carved ivory diptychs
was highly esteemed, and in the fourth century the
Emperor Theodosius issued an edict forbidding any but one
of the two consuls, one at Rome and the other at Constantinople,
to issue them.</p>

<p>In the matter of consular and official costume the Roman
carved ivory diptychs are of great importance.</p>

<p>Figures often appear on coins or gems, but they are
always very small. On the diptychs, however, they are
sufficiently large to show full details. The subjects
depicted on them are various. There are games, combats
in the circus, scenes from the Passion, boys emptying
sacks of prizes, figures of Saints, Adam and Eve, busts
and portraits of consuls both in medallions and full length.
The best collections of consular diptychs are to be found
at Rome, Milan, Monza, Paris, Munich, Berlin, Liverpool
and London.</p>

<p>Besides the consular there are also ecclesiastical
diptychs, the majority of which were probably only diverted
from their original intention and altered and adapted to a
new use. The original wax was removed and new
inscriptions engraved on the ivory, mostly lists of martyrs
or benefactors to the particular church which had possession
of the diptych.</p>

<p>There is one at Liège on which the names of the
bishops of Tongres are written, and there is another
similar one at Novara. It is probable that the liking
for ivory carvings on books arose from the lead given
by the ivory diptychs. Indeed in several instances the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
sides of ivory diptychs are actually inlaid in late bindings
of MSS.</p>

<p>The length of ancient rolls of vellum has often puzzled
bibliophiles. Rolls of narrow breadth are found 16 or 17
feet or more in length. A learned scholar on being asked
how he accounted for this extraordinary length was quite
puzzled, never having realised that the roll was in one
piece. The neck of
the giraffe seemed the
only possible solution.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_026.jpg" width="400" height="92" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span>&mdash;Egyptian papyrus roll, with
mud seals.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The writer however
consulted a clever
leather worker and
gave him a skin measuring about 3 feet by 2, suggesting
certain ways of cutting it. He produced eventually, by
wetting, pulling and pinning, a beautiful roll of nearly 4
inches in breadth and 16 feet 9 inches in length.</p>

<p>Mediæval leather workers were no doubt more skilled
and practised in this particular art than anyone now is,
and the experiment showed that there is really nothing out
of the way in the very long rolls which at first sight seem
so surprising.</p>

<p>Rolls were written upon in three ways. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
oldest rolls the usual way was to write lines across the
breadth of the roll, which was held upright before the
reader, and unrolled from the top downwards.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 125px;">
<img src="images/i_027a.jpg" width="125" height="403" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 17.</span>&mdash;Roll
written
upon across
its shorter
diameter.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A rare form of writing upon rolls is that
found in the prayers written on the strips
which are rolled up inside Buddhist prayer
wheels. Such prayers, however, are never read,
but are counted as being read through on each
revolution of the wheel. Each line of manuscript
runs along the entire length of the roll,
which is unrolled sideways. The prayer wheels
vary immensely in size, the best known being
the little hand ones chiefly used in Thibet;
they are variously ornamented.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span>&mdash;Roll written upon
longitudinally.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The form of writing in rolls that is of most
interest so far as books is concerned is a
modification of the Thibetan form. Instead
of each line running the whole
length of the roll, a space limit is now fixed, and the
lines of writing follow under each other, so that the
page form is at once
apparent. This form,
a late one, can be
seen in the case of the
Jewish scrolls of the
law. The roll is unrolled
sideways, and the
rollers at each end are often very handsomely decorated.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span>&mdash;Thibetan
prayer wheel.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But writing of this last kind on rolls has suggested
another arrangement in which the reading is more easy,
and the re-rolling of the roll itself avoided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be seen that a blank space is left between each of
the written “pages.” Now if the vellum, bark, or paper be
folded across these vacant spaces, one after the other,
backwards and forwards, like accordion
pleating, we shall find that we get a form
of book well known in the East and also
among primitive nations.</p>

form.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Curious examples of such converted rolls
can be seen in most museums, and they are
generally kept flat by means of two boards
front and back, but not otherwise fastened.</p>

<p>The Chinese and Japanese have taken
this particular form of evolution from the
roll to the book a step further, and by help
of the ancient device of “stabbing” the
flattened roll along one of its sides, they
produce a form called an “Orihon,” easy
to consult, strong, and the blank back of the roll so hidden
up that its existence is frequently not realised. But if
some of the leaves of an Orihon are cut, its real structure
becomes at once evident,
and a book will
be produced with letterpress
and blank paper
alternately in pairs. A
similar kind of alternation
shows now and
then in the case of MS. rolls that have been cut up, but
they are oftener arranged letterpress and blank alternately.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span>&mdash;Orihon.</p></div>
</div></div>

<p>Without realising it we still preserve this blank and
letterpress sequence, found in the converted roll, in official<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and legal manuscripts as well as in those intended for the
printer.</p>

<p>When the printing press took the place of the scribe, the
blank leaves had no further <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison d’être</i>, so they dropped
out for good.</p>

<p>Following the rule that the forms of binding have always
followed tolerably closely the forms of the manuscript they
have covered, we find that rolls were kept in cylindrical
boxes, called “scrinia.” Each roll was usually provided
with a little tag, so that if there were several of them in
one box they could easily be distinguished. The same
sort of tags are used to-day in the case of rolled maps kept
on shelves.</p>

<p>Until a late period the term parchment must be understood
to mean vellum. Now we call sheep skin “parchment”
and calf skin “vellum,” and they are prepared in the same
way with lime, so that not being tanned they are not strictly
“leather.” The finest vellum is prepared from the very
youngest and smallest calves, and it is the most beautiful
and suitable material for writing or printing upon that has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
ever yet been found. The surface is singularly even and
offers little or no resistance to a pen, so that every sort of
handwriting, square or round, is put upon it with equal
ease. Vellum has one fault alone, particularly when bound
in book form as distinct from a roll, and this is that the
edges are apt to cockle, and by so doing they not only make
the pages look ugly, but they also admit the dust. Often
and often magnificent vellum books, especially at the top,
show large vandykes of dust-stained spaces due to this
cockling, and all such books should be provided with a close
fitting cardboard cap, to be kept upon them whenever they
are not in use.</p>

<p>Parchment and vellum were both well-known to the
ancients, but their value as materials for writing upon does
not seem to have been fully acknowledged until the second
century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, until which period papyrus had held undisputed
pre-eminence for that purpose. At that time for
some reason the supply of papyrus from Egypt ran short,
and Eumenes II., King of Pergamum, successfully introduced
parchment in its stead. Parchment is so called
because it was first produced at Pergamum.</p>

<p>Until about the fifth century <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, vellum MSS. were
in the roll form, but then came a change to the book form
as we now know it. This change was probably due to the
fact that stabbed binding, the only sort then used, was not
suited to vellum. The few papyri that exist in book
form were stabbed, that is to say, the rectangular pages
were kept in position by a binding cord laced through holes
pierced sideways right through the entire thickness of the
back of the book. The marks of these holes can often be
seen along the inner margins of ancient papyri, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
also show in many instances of rebound copies of our early
English printed books. To-day plenty of examples of this
form of sewing can be seen in the Chinese and Japanese
books, “Orihons,” which are really links between the roll
and the book form. It is also largely used for thin books
of little value, and a modification of it can be seen in
numbers of magazines, books of advertisements, and the
like, which are kept together by abominable little clamps of
wire attached on the same principle. When such books
have to be properly bound the little clamps
have to be carefully removed, and it is
generally found that they have made an
indelible stain of rust on the paper, even if
they have not also torn it considerably.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 23.</span>&mdash;Stabbed binding.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In mediæval libraries or monasteries when
a book was to be made, vellum leaves were
cut into the required size and folded once
across the middle. The folded leaves were
then fitted inside each other in groups of four
(quaternions) or five (quinternions), or whatever
other number seemed good to the bookmaker. The
leaves were then marked in some slight way so that their
order might not be lost, and sent to the scribe to be
written upon.</p>

<p>The books count as folios because each original sheet
only forms two pages; the fact of their being arranged in
groups is accidental, and does not theoretically alter the
size of the book. For this the original skin of vellum
would have to be folded with certain further divisions, and
in the case of early manuscripts this was never done.</p>

<p>Vellum shows a different surface on the flesh side to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
on the hair side, and the scribe usually made his rule
marks with a blunt style to guide his writing on the hair
side, so that on this side the ruled lines are slightly
indented, whereas on the flesh side they show as little
ridges.</p>

<p>This point is apparently trivial, but if, as seems likely,
both Greek and Latin scribes were really very particular
and consistent in the way they alternated the two sides of
the vellum, then the matter becomes one of much critical
importance. Indeed, it has already been of the utmost
value in deciding questions
as to whether new pages had
been added or not to an old
book.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_032.jpg" width="300" height="192" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 24.</span>&mdash;Quaternion threaded
together.</p></div>
</div>

<p>When the scribe had made
his rulings he then doubled
up his sheets once, and
arranged them as he desired
with regard to the hair or
flesh sides. When a section of four sheets were fitted into
each other, so that when pressed together they made a
solid gathering, such a gathering is called a “Quaternion,”
from which term we derive our word “Quire.” This is a
normal state of things, but it is obvious that abnormal
arrangements might easily be made, from the insertion of a
single leaf to that of an entirely additional section.</p>

<p>Now the question arose of how best to fasten the quaternions
together, not only as to themselves but also as to
the other quaternions, which together formed the entire
book.</p>

<p>As to the quaternion itself, it must have been evident at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
once that a stitch of thread or fibre run from the innermost
fold right through to the outermost would hold the leaves
firmly together. It is likely enough that this was done
separately at first, and then the binder would have looked
at a small heap of such gatherings wondering how best to
keep them together, and it would soon occur to any constructive
mind to knot the loose ends of the threads
together, or else to supply a supplementary cord or cords
laid at right angles to the back of the sections on which
the projecting ends of the threads might be tied or sewn.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.</span>&mdash;Four threaded
quaternions tied on to transverse bands.</p></div>
</div></div>

<p>This, in fact, was done, and very shortly the best way of
fastening the sections on to such cords or threads was hit
upon&mdash;a method indeed that we have never bettered, and
which can still be found in the work of many of our best
modern binders.</p>

<p>At first this fastening together of the sections of a book
was no doubt done uncomfortably and roughly by hand, but
it soon became evident that some simple device in the form
of a skeleton frame might be contrived which would render
the operations of sewing and binding much easier. Not
only easier to execute but also giving a more regular and
workmanlike result.</p>

<p>The earliest known sewing frames were the same as are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
used now. There are two strong columns of wood fixed on
a broad platform, with a slot between their bases. From
capital to capital extends a bar, and the strips of leather,
vellum, or hempen cords which are to form the bands of
the book are looped upon it, and are kept taut by means
of metal keys attached to the other end, which lock into the
slot at the bottom. The bands can be quite easily adjusted
to any space the worker
desires.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_034.jpg" width="400" height="288" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 27.</span>&mdash;Modern hand-sewing press.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The book, ready for
sewing and in proper
order of sections, is laid
near the worker’s hand,
and he, or she, takes it
up by sections, one at a
time. The section to be
worked upon is laid
downwards on the little
platform, with its back close against the bands, and the
worker’s left hand keeps the section open in the middle,
while with the right hand a thread is drawn through the
back fold, from the inside to the outside, round the band,
and then back from the outside to the inside, and so on until
all the bands have been caught round. Then to end up,
the thread is passed through near the extreme end of the
fold and knotted, forming what is called a “kettle stitch,”
and from this point the whole operation is repeated, backwards,
with the next section. It sounds complicated, but
is not so really, and several sections could have been sewn
together in the time that it has taken me to describe the
sewing of one of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 28.</span>&mdash;Faulty sewing over a band.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Now comes an interesting point, and that is the exact
way in which the threads are passed over the bands. We
will first see that if the thread is drawn through the back
fold of the section, round a hand and back again through
another hole, that there is a weak construction, inasmuch
as the thread will have a strong tendency to cut through
the paper at <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, because there is in each case a side
strain. It therefore
seemed necessary that
the thread should
make its return journey by the same hole through which it emerged, but if
simply done, this did not mend matters much, as the strain
still tended to pull this hole open wider. A line of exit and
entrance without any side pull was needed, and this was
found by means of a very clever device. A broad band of
leather or vellum was cut through lengthways, leaving a
solid piece at each end.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_035b.jpg" width="300" height="42" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 29.</span>&mdash;Mediæval sewing
round double band.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Now when the sewer came to this band he ran the thread
straight through the slot, then
brought it round the entire
band, under it, between it and
the back of the book, and down
again, back through the slot,
and in at the same point from which it emerged. The result
of this is that there is no strain at all on the needle hole
through which the thread passes, as the pull is quite straight
both coming and going. This is undoubtedly the best
form of sewing a book on bands, and a book so treated is
said to be sewn on “double bands.” But our recent work
is not always true, although from the outside it appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
correct, because in numbers of cases such double bands
are simply glued on the outside of the back, the real
sewing, of a very inferior kind, possibly even done by
machinery, being hidden underneath the leather. Few
great binders except Charles Lewis have ever used sham
bands.</p>

<p>Flexible sewn books can be had now if wanted, but the
sewing on the bands is not quite the same as the fine
mediæval double bands I have described. It is, however,
practically nearly as good, and the bands themselves can
be made smaller.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 30.</span>&mdash;Modern sewing
round single band.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The modern method is to bring the needle and thread
through the back of the section as
usual, then give it one turn onwards
over the band and back again through
the same hole. It will be seen that
this is a thoroughly sound principle,
and brings no strain upon the back of the section.</p>

<p>The ends of the bands of limp vellum books have always
been treated in the same way; they are drawn straight
through the vellum at the joint and then back again and
fastened inside by means of the end paper.</p>

<p>The manner of drawing the bands of a “limp” vellum
bound book through the limp vellum cover is of much
interest, and it survives in many instances where boards
are used.</p>

<p>In principle it is the same process as is described further
on with regard to boarded books, but in the case of the
limp vellum bindings the ends of the bands are normally
visible for a short length, but in the case of boarded books
they are always covered up with the exception of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
vellum-covered boarded books in which the limp vellum
peculiarity is preserved.</p>

<p>Another small point of interest about the old limp
vellum bindings is that the head and tail bands are made
of the same sort of thin vellum strip as the main bands
and carefully drawn diagonally through the vellum at the
corners and fastened inside. Dealt with in this way the
head band becomes of real structural value, much of which
is lost if it is cut off short as is done in the large majority
of cases.</p>

<p>William Morris liked limp vellum bindings and often
used them, but without head bands. Instead of the short
strips of vellum used for bands in old books Morris used
specially prepared silk tapes, and brought them through
the vellum at the joint in the old-fashioned way. Instead
of being cut short and pasted down as the old limp vellum
bands were, Morris continued his tapes and brought them
out again near the front edge of the vellum, where they
could be tied. This is an excellent arrangement and
keeps such a book together in an admirable and effective
way.</p>

<p>Vellum bindings required flat backs because the material
would not yield sufficiently to be tucked round the
projecting bands of a normal flexible bound book, in which
the leather back is firmly fixed over the bands. Nevertheless
in several instances old vellum books, in boards, which have
been sewn on raised bands show traces of these bands in low
relief across the back. In such cases it is common to find
that some padding has been put in the spaces between the
bands so as to level the back up. Books treated in this way
are usually stiff to open and uncomfortable to consult.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>The flat back, which was necessary for the same reason
in the case of books bound at a later date in velvet, cloth,
silk or canvas, necessitated some modification of the thick
projecting bands of the ordinary book, and the requisite
flatness was attained by using strips of vellum or tape
instead of cords of hemp. Then it was found that it
was not necessary to fasten the back of the cover to the
back of the sections, so the “hollow back” came into
existence.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 31.</span>&mdash;Book bound with
“open” or “hollow” back,
and modern headband, cut off
at each end.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The majority of modern books are bound with hollow
backs; it can be recognised by
opening a book to the full
and seeing if the back is separate,
and it has one real virtue
as well as several vices. If a
book should happen to be
printed too far back, a hollow
back binding will enable it to “throw up,” and show the
printing right down to the inner edge of the paper, whereas
a flexible binding always tends to open less freely, especially
in the middle.</p>

<p>For books that are likely to be much used hollow backs
are unadvisable as they are sooner worn out, but for small
light books there is no doubt much to be said in their
favour.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_039.jpg" width="300" height="190" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 32.</span>&mdash;Back of book prepared
with cut trenches to hold the bands.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Among English binders of note I think Charles Lewis
was the first to use hollow backs extensively. But for
fine books there is no doubt that the old-fashioned
flexible sewing on raised bands is the best in the long
run. Books bound with hollow backs often have the
bands “sawn in,” that is to say, a trench is cut for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
each band across the back of the sections. In these
trenches the bands are laid, and the sewing is of a simpler
and quicker sort than it is when the thread is brought
round each band as it is in the flexible style. Moreover,
there is a weak point where the thread touches the edge of
the saw cut, and at this place the paper is always apt to
give. It is obvious that to cut away paper from the back
of a section must always be not only a barbarism but also
structurally wrong. Such a method of sewing a book can
only be excused on the score
of cheapness, and it may be
urged that in this case it does
not matter.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the
fifteenth century it was found
that the extreme tops and
bottoms of the backs of the
sections of bound books
not only looked untidy and
unfinished, but also that they tended to gape, in fact they
were weak points both structurally and artistically. When
it was once realised it was soon rectified, and a small
additional band was made of a strip of leather or vellum,
to fit along the outer edge of the top and bottom at
the back. This slip was then sewn on by means of
thread and button-hole stitching, being caught in at
intervals by a long stitch drawn through the centre of
one or other of the sections of the book. The loose
ends of the headband itself were drawn in to the
boards, forming in fact an additional band. The headband
is a point in the forwarding of a book which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
has not received much notice as yet, but it is of some
importance, as there is no doubt that much attention has
been paid by binders to the ornamentation of headbands
from mediæval times until now, and it is the first point in
the binding of a book in which ornament is considered.</p>

<p>Some of the early headbands are sewn over with strips
of soft leather, and at a later time they are cut in distinctive
ways, flat or round, and sewn over with silks of particular
colours or combinations of colours.</p>

<p>Of late years the vice of cutting off the ends of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
headband has come into being; these ends ought to be
drawn properly into the boards, as Mr. Douglas Cockerell
has indeed done for me in several instances. But no words
can adequately condemn the miserable ready-made coloured
slips which are often found simply
<em>stuck on</em> in the proper place.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 39.</span>&mdash;What a
book may do if the
back is not properly
rounded.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Vellum books were the first to be
properly bound. The papyri which
were stabbed are so rare that they may
be passed by. As I have already said,
vellum is apt to be curly; for this reason
the boards used for binding in early
days were made of thick wood, the heaviness of which,
even when unaided by clasps, tended to keep the vellum
flat.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_041b.jpg" width="200" height="108" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 40.</span>&mdash;Book with flat
back.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Beech wood was largely used for these old covers, and
from the German word “Buch,” meaning beech, we derive
our word “book.” Beechen boards
were light, decorative, and very
carefully dried and seasoned. It
is remarkable how flat such old
boards are, and they were no doubt
very highly valued as they often
have upon them the stamp of the
monastery in which they were used.</p>

<p>The edges of the boards are sometimes bevelled, from
the upper side in English or French books, and from the
under side in German books&mdash;but such a distinction must
not be taken as invariable. Boards often show signs of
having been used more than once, and it is rarely that any
decoration shows on the wood. In a few cases of German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
books may be found outline drawings of an heraldic
nature.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 41.</span>&mdash;Book with flat
back falling in.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The first bound books were made with flat backs, and the
boards fitted close upon the outer sheets of vellum, papyrus
or paper. In this formation, however,
it was found that there was
a strong liability for the back to
fall in and the foredge to project
outwards.</p>

<p>As early as the fifteenth century,
in the case of printed books on
paper, this fault of the back falling
in led some few binders to neutralise it by giving the back
of the book a rounded form by means of hammering, and
this quite prevented the falling in of the back. The exact
extent of the rounding can easily be seen by looking at the
front edge of a book, because the curves of the back and front
correspond. The boards, however,
remained in their first position,
flat on the outer sheets.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_042b.jpg" width="200" height="114" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 42.</span>&mdash;Book with
rounded back.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But another trouble was apparent
in both these cases, namely,
that when such books were opened,
the joint between the boards and
the back showed a tendency to pull
up the few pages next adjacent. In time these pages
became torn and injured, and constructively there was something
wrong with the principle of attachment.</p>

<p>Paper is soft, and when a “rounded” book was fitted
with hard boards and strongly pressed there would be a
certain tendency for the boards to sink into the mass of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
paper and to throw up a small ridge along the edge of the
back. Such a small accidental ridge is often found on old
paper books.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_043a.jpg" width="200" height="111" alt="" />

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 44</span>.&mdash;Book rounded
and backed, before the
boards are put on.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But there is no doubt that the actual process of making
an intentional groove for the boards
to fit in was practised by a few
fifteenth century binders in England.
This groove is made by an
extension of the process of rounding
the back, and it is produced by
hammering the back over two hard
boards carefully placed in the
proper position. The shape of a back thus treated is
theoretically as shown in Fig. 44, and it will be seen that the
actual joint now falls away from the body of the book and is
removed to the artificial line along
the outer edge of the groove, and
from this line the projecting bands
are drawn in to the boards. If this
operation of “backing” is properly
done it is almost impossible for the
back of a book to fall in. It will
always open easily and return to its
original form, and if the bands are
properly attached to the boards,
the latter will never fall off.</p>

<p>Although the principle of backing was known at the
early time mentioned, it was not universally understood
and practised until quite recent times. Now, however, it is
fully recognised as one of the most important processes in
the binding of books, especially large ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>We have seen that the book sewn in leather bands has
the ends of these bands left loose, projecting in the case of
a large book some two or three inches. Holes were now
carefully cut along the back edge of the board to fit the
ends of the bands, sloping upwards, and some little way in
other slots were cut from the upper surface of the board to
meet them. Into these holes the ends of the bands were
drawn, and when in proper position they were pegged
down with one or more small wooden pegs. Sometimes the
bands were drawn right through the boards and fastened
inside. Numbers and numbers of instances
of this work exist and are quite
sound to-day. But such books do not
open satisfactorily, as there is a disagreeable
pull upon the outer sections when
the book is opened. In fact, the junction
between the bands and the boards
is not scientifically correct, because the
backs are not rounded.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_044.jpg" width="150" height="175" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 45.</span>&mdash;Half-bound
book.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The vulnerable part of the binding
will now be seen to be the soft threads which cover the
bands where they adjoin the back of the sections of the
book, and to protect these delicate threads a strip of leather
was cut, damped and pressed over the bands so as to fit
quite closely, and fastened on with glue, projecting a short
way over on to the board itself so as to cover up the holes
used for the bands. This is called a “half-binding.” On
the leather of such half-bindings there is usually some
blind tooling, lines or rolls or even small cameo stamps.</p>

<p>Mediæval bindings are commonly provided with clasps.
The original reason of this was to help to keep the vellum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
leaves flat, but of course artistic binders saw that clasps
might be made very ornamental, and so many of them are.
They have survived as ornamental adjuncts to a binding
until the present day, although there is no necessity for
them.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_045.jpg" width="200" height="231" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 46.</span>&mdash;Mediæval book
with bosses, corner
pieces and clasps.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Bosses in the centre and at the corners of mediæval
bindings were of structural use, as they protected the
actual boards of the book from wear. In early days books
were kept upon their sides and probably
had flat boards between each
volume. So the bosses took the
wear and preserved the books.
Many of the mediæval bosses and
corners have ornamental settings;
they are generally of brass, but
sometimes of silver or wood. The
titles of such books were sometimes
written on the front edges and sometimes
on a slip of paper fastened
under horn on the upper board, and
in the late fifteenth century they were sometimes lettered
in gold or blind, also on the boards.</p>

<p>It happened that the art of Byzantium was in its
prime just about the same time that vellum began to be
arranged in sections&mdash;in book form&mdash;in contradistinction
to the roll form. So we find some of the finest examples
of Byzantine art on bookbindings. Of course it must be
understood that these richly worked covers are only
ornamentally added to the true binding underneath, and the
actual work of the binding is more or less as I have already
described it. But the decorative art in these cases is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
predominant that they are generically known as “Byzantine”
bindings.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 47.</span>&mdash;German binding
of about the eleventh

</div>

<p>The large majority of the known specimens of this kind
are no longer in company with their original manuscripts.
Many of them are preserved simply as loose covers, and
alien manuscripts have been inserted in others. I expect
that there are still considerable numbers of these bindings
preserved in remote churches and monasteries in Central
Europe, and some day perhaps some
traveller with sufficient knowledge
and time at his command will make
search for them. But for the present
fine and genuine examples of
Byzantine bindings are of great
rarity. It is said that there are
not more than about three hundred
of them known. The life history
of many of these is well known, and
so are many of the additions and
alterations to which they have been
subjected during their long life.
Luckily some of the finest are now
safely housed in our London museums, and others are,
or are likely to be, safe in a great local museum.</p>

<p>To be able to judge whether these bindings are genuine,
a librarian must be an antiquary, a goldsmith and silversmith,
skilled both in repoussé work, engraving and cast
work, a gem cutter, an enameller, a skilled bookbinder, and
an artist, and if he fails in one of these knowledges his
judgment cannot be relied on. An ordinary art critic who
possesses “Flaire” can pick up a certain amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
knowledge by reason of having made many mistakes and
profited by them, and if he has been fortunately able to
associate himself only with true and known fine examples
for a long time, he may eventually be a good guesser. But
no true judgment can be given without actual technical
knowledge.</p>

</div>

<p>The result of all this is, that collectors of such bindings
have been freely victimised. It is
not really difficult to copy or to
imitate a Byzantine binding&mdash;it is
not nearly so difficult as to counterfeit
a fine Le Gascon or a fine
Roger Payne. It does not so much
concern the binder as the metal
worker, and in metal a little skill
goes a long way, and so it does in
the cloisonne enamel work which
alone is found in these bindings.
The present market price of a very
fine Byzantine binding&mdash;a known
one&mdash;will run into five figures, so
it is little to be wondered at that
it pays the clever <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faussaires</i> of the Continent to direct their
attention to covers of this kind. They need not even take
the trouble to provide manuscripts for the inside; loose
covers will sell with equal readiness.</p>

<p>Ivory carving played an important part on early bindings.
Apart from diptychs, the earliest known decorative binding
consists of plaques of ivory carved with Biblical scenes,
and having in the centre a lamb within a wreath of
cloisonne work, with inlays of coloured glass. It is now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
kept in the cathedral treasury at Milan, and is without its
original inside; it is attributed to the fifth century.</p>

<p>Early Irish manuscripts were usually bound in quite
simple limp leather covers, but these were kept in book
boxes or “Cumdachs,” all of which still existing are of the
greatest interest.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 563px;">
<img src="images/i_048.jpg" width="563" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 49.</span>&mdash;The upper cover of the Cumdach of the Stowe
Missal.</p></div>
</div>

<p>One of the finest is that of the Stowe Missal, dating from
about the eleventh century. It belonged originally to the
monastery of Lorrha in Tipperary, whence it was taken to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the Irish monastery of Ratisbon. In 1784 it was found by
Mr. John Grace in Austria, and afterwards belonged to the
Stowe Library, and Lord Ashburnham, from whom it was
purchased by the nation in 1883 with the rest of his library,
and then deposited in the museum of the Royal Irish
Academy.</p>

<p>The lid is ornamented with a large cross set with pearls
and metal bosses, having in the centre a large oval crystal
over a pink ground, and enclosed with recent enamels, no
doubt replacing old ones. At each end of the cross is a
large jewel. The spaces between the arms of the cross
contain silver gilt plates engraved with figures of Saints,
and on the silver edge plates is an inscription in Irish
inviting the reader to “Pray for Dunchad descendant of
Taccan of the family of Cluan who made this.” This may
therefore be called the earliest signed binding in the world,
if a cumdach can be considered a binding. No doubt
much of the work now on this lid, as well as some of the
jewels and their settings, have been added since the original
work was made.</p>

<p>The base of the box has a similar ornamentation upon it,
but the jewels and enamels are all gone, the spaces between
the arms of the cross being filled with silver plates cut into
an open pattern set over bronze gilt.</p>

<p>The sides of the box are much destroyed, but they have
fortunately not been restored. The ornamentation consists
of enamelled bosses or curious castings in the centre of
each side, flanked by panels of open designs cut out of thin
silver over gilt, and corner ornaments of cast work. There
are small bosses of blue enamel.</p>

<p>The remarkable open work over gilt bronze occurs again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
in the base of the cumdach containing Molaise gospels, it
also belongs to the eleventh century, and this sort of ornamentation
seems to be characteristic of Irish work of that
time. The lid of the box is ornamented in a modification
of the same idea, but in this case the bronze showing
through the silver is beautifully worked. The main idea
is a cross, and between the arms are the evangelistic
emblems, and with their names, Leo, Aquila, Homo,
Taurus. An inscription asks us to “Pray for Cenn, for
the successor of Molaise for whom this case was made by
Gillabaithain the artisan.” It is possible that this may be
a little earlier than the Stowe cumdach.</p>

<p>A few more cumdachs are known, about ten of them
altogether, and others are recorded only.</p>

<p>There is that of Dimma’s book, of the Cathach of the
O’Donnells, and several others, some of which are quite
plain.</p>

<p>Other book cases were made of beautifully worked leather.
The satchel of the Book of Armagh is one of these, and
leather cases or “Forels” were made of cuirbouilli in the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, particularly in Italy.
These forels were in the shape now known as “slip off”
cases, and they generally had attachments for a strap.
They are always charmingly chased, and often bear
heraldic ornamentation.</p>

<p>Cuirbouilli was calf or hide, worked with knife, style, or
hammer, and then probably boiled in oil, but the exact
process that was used is now unknown. It is very strong,
and its value was known in England, where it was used to
make wrist guards for archery, but as far as I know it was
never used here for bindings or covers for bindings. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
have heard the calf or sheep bindings of the early sixteenth
century, bearing panel stamps, described as cuirbouilli, but
they are not so.</p>

<p>The earliest cover still containing its original manuscript
is probably that given with other treasure to Theodelinda,
Queen of the Lombards, by Pope Gregory the Great, in
the seventh century. It is now kept in the cathedral
treasury at Monza.</p>

<p>The manuscript is described in a contemporary document
as being “theca persica inclusam,” and, so far, its cover
resembles the Irish cumdachs. The case is of gold, ornamented
with a large cross, outlined with lines of small flat
garnets, with sapphires and emeralds, set in cloisons. The
body of the cross is richly jewelled with cabochon cut stones
and pearls, and at the extremity of each arm is a curious
glass bead of millefiori glass, green with a little red flower
in the centre.</p>

<p>Between the arms of the cross are four gamma shaped
ornaments, each set with small flat jewels. Across the
sides are bands of gold on which are engraved the words
<span class="smcap">De Donis Dei offerit Theodelenda reg. gloriosissima
sancto Joanni Baptiste in Basilica quem ipsa fundavit in
Modicia prope palatium suum</span>. A handsome border with
flat garnets enclosed the whole, and the four cameos set
near the gammas are a recent addition. Byzantine art is
generally considered as a decadent form of Roman art, but
in this particular instance there is much Greek feeling, and
it is in all respects, excepting perhaps the inscription, a
magnificent piece of work.</p>

</div>

<p>The binding of the Gospels of Lindau has now two
sides of different dates, each of which has been repaired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and added to in recent times. The earlier of the two, far the
finer, is probably contemporary with the manuscript, having
been made about the later half of the ninth century, as the
Abbey of the Noble Canonesses at Lindau was founded by
the Emperor Lewis the Pious in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 834. A large golden
cross pattée is the chief motive of this beautiful piece of
work, and it is ornamented with rare enamels showing
bust figures wearing stoles, and
jewels in great variety, the
borderings being inlaid with
small flat pieces of garnet. The
spaces between the arms of the
cross are filled with bronze
plaques elaborately ornamented
with Celtic interlacings in
chiselled work. The workmanship
is probably Irish, and was
most likely done abroad, possibly
enough at Lindau itself, by some
Irish artists who had emigrated.
Irish jewellers and enamellers of
this early time were justly celebrated,
and their services were secured whenever possible.</p>

<p>The later side of the binding is one of the finest existing
specimens of Carlovingian art. It is radically different from
the earlier side and was probably added about the eleventh
or twelfth century.</p>

Gospels of Lindau, the
more recent side.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In the centre is a large cross on which is a gilt figure of
our Lord in the attitude of the crucifixion. The cross is
outlined by a structure of open work of gold ornamented
with filagree work and thickly set with jewels. Between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the arms of the cross are angels worked in repoussé, and
rich bosses of gold and jewels, raised on arcades of open
work. The border is of great richness, and is thickly
sown with large jewels cut “en cabochon,” many of them
pierced longitudinally, betraying in all probability an
Oriental provenance. No doubt this was originally made
for some valuable manuscript now lost, and it was used to
replace the original simple lower
cover of the Gospels of Lindau
at some unknown time.</p>

<p>The book was formerly in the
possession of the Earl of Ashburnham,
but now it is gone to
America.</p>

<p>Beautiful Byzantine work of the
twelfth century is to be seen upon
the carved and jewelled binding
of the Psalter of Melissenda,
daughter of Baldwin II., King
of Jerusalem, and wife of Fulk,
his successor. The ivory covers
measure eight by six inches, and
are elaborately carved in bas relief with Biblical scenes. On
each side are six circles, and in each circle a little figure
group, on one side representing episodes in the life of David
and on the other works of mercy. There is lettering run in
with red, giving the names of each of the personages
shown, and their eyes are set with tiny rubies or emeralds
cut “en cabochon” like coloured grains of sand. The
spaces between the circles are filled with other Biblical
or symbolical figures, scrolls and animals, and a beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
interlacing border encloses the whole, set with turquoises
and rubies.</p>

<p>The carver’s name, “<span class="smcap">Herodius</span>,” is cut in the lower
cover. The workmanship on these ivories is extremely
fine, and there is no doubt they were made to be used as a
binding. The majority of ivory carvings found on mediæval
bookbindings appear to have been simply added, having
been originally made for some other purpose. But there
are notable exceptions, particularly in the Bibliothèque
Nationale at Paris. The shape in which the plaque of ivory
is cut will often give a valuable indication in this matter.</p>

<p>The finest Byzantine binding now in England is probably
that known as the <a id="Ref_54"></a>Gospels of Charlemagne, now in the
Victoria and Albert Museum. It is nearly square, and the
upper side is overlaid with gilt metal, enamels and gems.
In the centre is a seated figure of Our Lord in the attitude
of Benediction, in repoussé work. Round this is a band of
white and green enamelled lettering, restored, on which
are two hexameter lines: “<span class="smcap">Mathevs et Marcvs Lvcas
scsq Johane vox horv qvatvor reboat te xpe Redemptor.</span>”
The outer border is made up of rectangular plaques of
enamels, gold work and jewels.</p>

<p>The work here is also largely restored, but it is, as a
rule, admirably done, and where the old work remains,
especially in the gold, it is of a high excellence. The
jewels have, for the most part, been restored. As the
book is now it is a splendid and dignified example of its
kind; the under side is simply covered with strong red
leather, with a cross marked by small studs. Like many
of these splendid altar books, this one is said to have
served as a Pax.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>The manuscript itself is of the tenth century, and belonged
to the Abbey Church of St. Maurice d’Agaune, and
from here it was stolen in the fourteenth century. It
afterwards found a home at Sion, and was purchased for
the Victoria and Albert Museum at the Spitzer sale in
1893.</p>

<p>No doubt examples of rich monastic bindings did exist
in England, but none of them are now known. It is
likely enough that their value condemned them, and that
they were entirely destroyed in the earlier half of the sixteenth
century to swell the revenues of the king. The
manuscripts belonging to these destroyed covers have,
luckily, been kept, and numbers of them came to the
British Museum by gift of George II.</p>

<p>Two ornamental bindings only of English origin now
remain; these are both simple, they are the St. Cuthbert’s
Gospels and the English coronation book of Henry I.
These are described in <a href="#Page_181">Chapter VIII.</a></p>

<p>There were plenty of leather bindings ornamented with
blind tooling or cut leather work in mediæval times, and
these also are described later on.</p>

<p>The idea of ornamenting bindings with sunk panels is of
Arab origin. The fashion came to Europe by way of Venice,
and the Venetians themselves quickly saw that the possibilities
of decorating bindings were largely increased by
this device. It is done by means of two boards, the upper
of which is pierced, then the whole is covered with leather
and ornamented with painted work or stamped work as the
case may be. In inferior bindings of this sort, the sunk
panels are sometimes produced simply by hard pressure,
but the state of the edges of the panels will soon show how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
they are made. If they are steep there are the double
boards, if very sloping there may only be one.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth had some of these Venetian sunk
bindings presented to her and she liked them. Consequently
there were a few examples of it made in England
in the sixteenth century. At a later time Charles Lewis
bound several large books with double boards in this way,
and I think he was the only important English binder who
has ever done so to any great extent.</p>

<p>The double boards have left a trace of their existence in
the form of a trench which is frequently found along the
edges of the boards of sixteenth century bindings of English,
Italian, and French workmanship. The trench, however,
is merely a survival and does not necessarily imply the
actual existence of double boards. It is a distant tribute
to our indebtedness to the East.</p>

<p>In some of the double-board books bound for Queen
Elizabeth, with sunk panels, the headband is curiously
produced away from its normal finishing point and is carried
right round the entire edge of the boards in the trench
between the boards. It is a decorative and curious
peculiarity, and I have never met with it in any foreign
books.</p>

<p>Wooden boards were used for bindings until about the
end of the fifteenth century, when the idea of using several
layers of paper pasted together&mdash;paste boards&mdash;was thought
of. In fact, paste boards may be considered to have been
introduced about the same time as printing, and waste
printed matter was often used for making them with.</p>

<p>There are many instances in which valuable printed
matter has been found hidden up in binder’s boards, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a><br /><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
as these can generally be soaked apart and cleaned, we
already owe the preservation of several unique fragments
to the fact of their having been used for bindings.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 52.</span>&mdash;Painted Persian binding (Nadir Shah at the battle of
Karnul).</p></div>
</div>

<p>Persian manuscripts of the seventeenth to the nineteenth
centuries are often ornamented in a manner which is of
considerable interest. They are bound in paste boards like
all other Oriental bindings known to me, and are covered
with some sort of gesso applied in a thin layer. On this
gesso are paintings of varied merit; some of them, especially
the historical and hunting scenes, are extremely well done,
and others, mostly floral, are of a commonplace character.
The boards are sometimes painted inside and out.</p>

<p>The painting is done in water-colours, and is of the
same sort as is found with the manuscript inside, but
generally by an inferior artist. When finished the painting
was thickly varnished, and this varnish has darkened by
time into a mellow golden colour which improves the
appearance of the colour work underneath.</p>

<p>The darkening of this varnish has, however, had a
remarkable result: the photographic ray cannot pierce it
except here and there&mdash;in fact, the painting is covered by
a non-actinic curtain. A photograph will only show the
surface of the varnish with here and there a patch where
the blue colour underneath succeeds in making itself felt.</p>

<p>Ornamental though these painted and varnished bindings
are, there is unfortunately a great and inherent delicacy
about them, and it is that the varnished surface is badly
given to chipping off. It is difficult to say what the best
remedy for this chipping or flaking off is; it is probably
due to the discrepancy in hardness between the hard
varnish and the soft boards; it seems to be radical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Experiments are needed in this matter, but owners of
fine specimens, even if chipped, are naturally chary of
allowing experiments which may do harm as well as good.
I should say that probably much good might be done by
dropping a little collodion so as to make it run down
between the loosened surfaces; it will act as a cement and
strengthen as well as fasten them together. It is also likely
that thin glue applied several times might also do good used
in the same way, but I believe collodion is better and
penetrates weak places more readily.</p>

<p>The same styles of ornamentation are used on mirror
cases and other small objects, so that although many
bindings are so treated, yet the method is not one
exclusively used for such purpose. But no doubt the
finest work was put on bindings, some of which are large.</p>

<p>Another Persian manner is that of using large metal
stamps impressed with elaborate arabesques. The impressions
from these stamps of course give a design in relief.
The whole impression is generally gilded in various tints,
and the small design itself is often picked out with a little
colour. Many of these arabesque panel stamps are of
wonderful beauty.</p>

<p>Arabic and other Oriental bindings have a curious flap
projecting from one of the boards, which covers and
protects the front edges. The flaps are ornamented in the
same way as the rest of the binding.</p>

<p>The sewing and the paper of all these books is weak and
light, but there is always work of much interest on the
bindings. The backs are flat and the paste boards are thin
and covered with very thin leather. They are usually
ornamented inside and outside with blind and gilt work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
stamped and cut work, and hand painting, in much
variety.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_060.jpg" width="400" height="256" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 53.</span>&mdash;Oriental binding with flap.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The open work cut with a knife from thin leather is
remarkable for its extraordinary precision and delicacy; it
is usually in arabesques with small flowers, and often
coloured by hand. It is always set on a background of
colour, either painted or a bit of coloured paper. But the
work is very frail, and
panels of it are rarely
found perfect.</p>

<p>Oriental bindings
are altogether weak,
and they will not
stand hard wear.</p>

<p>Now we have, chiefly
from America, machines
that will do
almost every one of the hand-operations for binding a book.
There are sewing machines that only want to be fed with
thread and the books to be sewn; there are casing machines
of wonderful speed and accuracy, backing machines and
binding machines. The only one thing that cannot yet be
done by a machine is the pasting down the ends of the
bands or tapes inside the boards. I rather think that
many of these machines strain the paper badly, and also
they require setting elaborately to a certain size. They
are very useful for large, cheap editions, but little use for
good miscellaneous work. Nothing is really so good as the
old-fashioned sewing on raised bands by hand.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="titlefont">PAPER.</span></h2>


<p class="chapblock center">Paper&mdash;Watermarks&mdash;Quiring.</p>

<p>Although we get our word “paper” from “papyrus,”
this latter was not a paper at all. The essential characteristic
of a true paper is the matting or felting together of
small fibres, whether these be of wood, linen, or other substance.
Papyrus was the inner bark of a beautiful reed,
which grows along the banks of the Nile, and from a very
remote period strips of this bark were laid over each other
at right angles, fixed together with gum, or perhaps a little
Nile mud, and used for writing upon with a soft pen. The
right-angular lines of the two layers of papyrus bark can
easily be seen on any papyrus MS.</p>

<p>Papyrus is not a good substance for writing upon; it is
at first too soft, and then it gets brittle and is apt to
crumble away. By sticking successive strips of papyrus to
each other ancient scribes produced long rolls of manuscript,
and from these rolls we derive many of the book
terms which are still in use. The most obvious is “volume,”
which is from “volvere,” “to roll up”; and “Bible” comes
from the Greek <a id="Ref_62"></a>“βυβλοἱ,” meaning the inner bark of
papyrus.</p>

<p>In China the possibility of making thin feltings with
silk fibre was probably known at a very remote period, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
it is likely enough that from some such unsatisfactory production
the better and usable kinds made of vegetable
fibres evolved itself. We cannot now say when the possibility
of felting together fibres of wood or grass first became
known to the Chinese, but it was certainly well understood
in the fifth or sixth centuries, because specimens of it still
exist.</p>

<p>In the middle of the eighth century, in 751 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, there
were certain tribal disturbances on the Chinese frontier of
Persia, and one of the combatants called in the help of the
Chinese. These, however, suffered defeat at the hands of
the Arab governor of Samarkand, who brought back some
Chinese prisoners to his town. These men were acquainted
with the Chinese methods of making paper.</p>

<p>From these Chinese prisoners the Arabs and their friends
the Persians learnt the art of paper-making with vegetable
fibres, but the supply in this particular very soon gave out,
and because enough suitable fibres were difficult to get they
mixed them with pulped rags. Eventually the Samarkand
paper-makers used rags only, and these they easily got in
sufficient quantities from old linen clothes, and also the
mummy wrappings from Egypt were made use of in the
same way.</p>

<p>From the Arabs the knowledge of paper-making passed
rapidly to Europe, and by the middle of the tenth century
it had entirely superseded the use of papyrus.</p>

<p>The researches of Dr. J. Wiesner and Dr. J. Karabacek,
both professors of the University of Vienna, have been of
incalculable value as regards the composition and history of
ancient paper, and they were fortunate enough to have the
opportunity of examining the papers in the collection of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Archduke Rainer, among which are specimens of very early
work. The professors have examined these and other
old papers microscopically and chemically, and found that
from the beginning it was considered necessary to load
papers with some binding or filling substance; they found
starch, starch flour, probably from rice, and among the
Chinese papers a dressing of powdered gypsum. Without
some such dressing the papers would have resembled our
blotting paper, and it would have been almost impossible to
write upon them.</p>

<p>Professor Wiesner found that Chinese papers of the eighth
century were really mixed papers; they contained fibres of
mulberry bark, hemp and rags. Rags of fishing nets themselves
would contain fibres of flax, hemp, and China grass.
But the main constituent of ancient Chinese paper is fibre
of mulberry-bark, and I believe it is so still, although China
grass fibre is also much used.</p>

<p>Specimens of Chinese papers from the eighth century
onwards can be seen at the British Museum. They are soft,
but have lasted fairly well, and do not appear to show any
wire marks. The colour of these papers is much the same
as Chinese papers made now, but in some instances they
have certainly darkened as modern wood pulp papers
also do.</p>

<p>One of the later specimens, a bank note issued during the
reign of the Emperor Hung-wu, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1368-1399, is made of a
darkened pulp, probably due to admixture with a little lamp
black, and on it are lighter impressions from large stamps
bearing the square seal letters. It is just possible that
these marks may be of the nature of watermarks, and were
impressed while the pulp was soft and wet, but it is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
possible now to take the bank note up from the cardboard
on which it has been pasted, as to do so would probably
cause it to fall to pieces, so it cannot, for the moment, be
properly examined.</p>

<p>Corean and Japanese papers were the same as Chinese,
and they all look as if there are no wire marks or watermarks
upon them, with the one exception I have mentioned,
but Dr. Wiesner says that by the ninth century marks
show in many instances which prove that papers were
made in moulds or sieves with network bottoms, the impression
of which remains like our “chains”
or laid marks. In the King’s Library
at the British Museum is shown a piece
of Oriental paper, an official letter in
Coptic, dated <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1048. It does not look
so strong or good as the Chinese paper,
but resembles thin blotting paper, and
shows no wire mark.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 54.</span>&mdash;Watermark

John Tate in
1495.</p></div>
</div>

<p>An early example of European paper
is preserved in the Record Office in
London. It is a letter from the Count of Toulouse to
Henry III., and is dated <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1216. In France, however,
by this time, the making of paper had been understood for
some time, as it was made there in 1189. In Belgium
it was not made until 1551, in which year a paper mill was
set up at Tourneppe by Henri de Nevere.</p>

<p>By the end of the fifteenth century paper-making in
Europe was perfectly understood, and the papers of that
date, and for some time after it, are frequently excellent in
every way, and as sound, strong, and good now as they were
when first made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>The first English book printed on English paper is Bartholomaeus,
<cite>De Proprietatibus Rerum</cite>, published 1495-6.
The paper is of high quality, it shows a fine wire mark, and
a watermark of a double circle enclosing an eight-pointed star.
The paper was made at Hertford by John Tate, who was
afterwards Lord Mayor of London; the title page is cut in
wood, and the book is illustrated with outline wood-cuts.</p>

<p>At the end are some verses, and among these occur the
lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquotebase">“And John Tate the younger Joye mote he broke,</div>
<div class="indentbase">Which late hath in England doo make this paper thynne,</div>
<div class="indentbase">That now in our Englysch this boke is prynted Inne.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is paper to be proud of, and John Tate the younger
would unquestionably look upon the large majority of our
modern papers with the utmost scorn, and he would be
perfectly justified in doing so.</p>

<p>The early method of making paper was to allow the pulp
to settle at the bottom of a trough like a sieve, with a wire
bottom, in which the wires were arranged in a certain way,
thick and thin, the trade mark of the maker also being outlined
in wire. The faint marks these wires cause in the paper are
called watermarks, and although at first they were makers’
marks, they eventually denoted the size of the sheet of
paper on which they were shown.</p>

<p>The present method of making paper from rags is to pulp
them thoroughly in water, and let the white particles
become so thoroughly diffused that the liquid in which
they float looks like thin milk.</p>

<p>This thin mixture, however, if left quiet, very quickly
resolves itself into a sediment of white fibres with clear water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
above them. If now the superambient water can be drawn
off, and the sediment pressed flat, paper is the result. But it
is not so easily done as said. In order to catch the sediment
in the most satisfactory way, the milky fluid containing the
rag fibres is allowed to flow in a thin stream over a long,
shallow trough, which is kept moving onwards and is also
so arranged that it has a sideways tremble, backwards and
forwards as well. The effect of this is that when the further
end of the trough is reached, on its floor there is a thin
continuous film of slightly matted fibres, the water from
which has flowed away along the sides of the trough. Now
another device comes into play; a thin light roller of wire
presses lightly on the wet film, and by this pressure the
little fibres are pressed upon each other so that they mat,
interlace, and cohere together. The paper in this state is
of course very delicate, but by reason of a quick drying and
carrying off on light rollers it soon acquires the strength
necessary to enable it to hold together until it is quite dry.
Then it goes through several other stages, the most important
of which is pressing. The various processes can
obviously be modified easily enough so as to make a thin
paper or a thick one. Paper made in this way with a
vibratory trough is called “machine made,” and by reason
of its fibres laying more or less in a uniform direction the
resulting paper is more easily torn in one direction than in
the other. If a circular piece be cut out of such pulp and
laid on water it will tend to fold up two of its opposite sides.</p>

<p>But ancient paper was made in a trough held by hands
and given a lateral movement, then pressed and dried in
some simple way. By such a procedure the fibres are
thoroughly mixed, and do not lie in one direction more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
in another, so that if a circular bit of such paper be laid in
water it will turn upwards at the edge evenly all round, and
look like a little saucer.</p>

<p>I have mentioned a light wire roller which presses the
wet film more or less into shape just before it leaves the
long trough to be dried. As long ago as the thirteenth
century in Europe the fact that devices could be impressed
upon the undried film by thinning it and making it more
transparent where touched appears to have been known, and
from about that time onwards “watermarks” have fortunately
been applied in the same manner, namely, so as to
come in the middle of the first leaf of the pair forming a
folio. It is also fortunate that the “chains” or wires
forming the rollers have always been laid in the same way;
it is certainly the obvious one, but obvious ways are not
always adopted. The result is that by observing the direction
of the strong chain marks and the fine “laid” marks
between them much information concerning the folding of
the original sheets can be obtained.</p>

<p>In very early papers these rules cannot be safely followed,
because early chain marks as well as early watermarks
were not produced in the same reliable way. The paper
being made in moulds with wire netting at the bottom, the
impression came below the paper instead of above it as in
the case of the roller, and also the sizes of the sheets were
more likely to differ.</p>

<p>Watermarks are the semi-transparent devices which show
on certain pages of a printed book. They are to be seen on
most papers of the fourteenth to the eighteenth centuries,
and there has been a good deal written about them, especially
abroad. The devices were outlined in wire and set in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the bottom of the trough or on the wire roller I have just
described, so that the lines are impressed upon the pulp just
when it is in its most sensitive condition. The pressure
from the wire device thins the pulp wherever it is touched,
and so when dry the device shows lighter than the rest of
the paper.</p>

<p>These marks should be called wire marks rather than
watermarks, and the French word for them, “Filigranes,”
is more correct than ours. The difference in tint between
a watermark and the rest of the paper is so distinct that a
photographic negative placed under one will render a capital
photograph of it, far better than any drawing, but it needs
a long exposure.</p>

<p>Watermarks are already of considerable value to Bibliographers,
and it is likely that in the near future they will
be much more noticed, especially in English books. Many
frauds have already been detected by reason of the watermarks,
as it is a point that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faussaires</i> have so far paid little
attention to. The marks are, however, not to be relied on
after about 1750, as they do not run reliably in machine
made or wove papers.</p>

<p>Armorial devices have been largely used as watermarks.
Many of the earlier marks show the arms of towns, especially
continental ones, and among others there are the arms
of France, Portugal, William and Mary and Queen Anne,
shown in full heraldic outlines.</p>

<p>The Holbein family of Ravensburg bore a bull’s head as
their armorial badge, and they were paper makers, so the
bull’s head shows on their paper as a watermark. It was
afterwards much copied, and during the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries it became a favourite mark on German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
papers. There does not seem to have been any strict copyright
in any of the devices used as watermarks. They were
freely used by any one who cared to do
so, but the copies were never very carefully
made, they were always variants of
the original. They were moreover generally
accompanied by another mark, that
of the maker, on another part of the
paper. The same privilege of using a
“maker’s” mark was also allowed to the
silversmiths in addition to the official
hall mark.</p>

<p>To some slight extent watermarks on
paper made for particular books have
followed the subjects of those books, and
in accordance with a loyal feeling there
are instances of a crown watermark being used on paper
prepared for special copies of books intended for presentation
to reigning sovereigns.</p>

<p>On papers used for early English printed books we find
the favourite German bull’s head,
bunches of grapes, unicorns, dogs,
hands with stars, and shears. These
appear in several sizes, and show
many varieties and modifications
of their original designs.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries a greater variety
occur; on English paper there is found the post horn
and the fool’s cap, sometimes showing as a cap only
and sometimes as a fool’s head with cap and bells. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
similar design was largely used abroad. In the time of
Charles I. a crown was a usual watermark on official folio
paper, but the Rump Parliament ordered that the foolscap
should be in future substituted for it, which was done.
“Double foolscap” is still used as a designation for a certain
size of printing paper, so also is “double-crown.”</p>

<p>The foolscap itself shortly gave way to a figure of
Britannia or a lion rampant. The post horn was another
common watermark here; it gave its name to its paper
about 1670, when the mail carrier was accustomed to
announce his approach by a blast from his horn. The
name “Post” still designates a certain size of printing
paper. The smallest folio paper of the seventeenth century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
was marked with a watermark of a “pot,” and hence the
name.</p>

<p>For specially printed books it is a pretty fancy to have a
coat-of-arms set as a watermark, and it is now and then
done, but I fear few readers notice it. Many papers are
now made without watermarks, and it is likely enough that,
except for trade terminology, they will gradually die out
altogether as being unnecessary.</p>

<p>The possibilities of artistic watermarking have not yet
been fully realised. At the St. Louis Exhibition in 1904
there was a German exhibit which showed the remarkable
effect which could be made by impressing paper pulp by
means of a photographic plate in relief.</p>

<p>The papers which had been so treated were set up in a
frame with a light behind them, and they looked like most
delicate paintings in monotone. Those exhibited were
portraits of celebrities, and they were not only excellent
but possessed the quality of permanence in a remarkable
degree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Printing papers are generally white, but sometimes they
have been used in colour, green, pink, blue or yellow.
Such papers are now and then found in Italian, German,
and English books, more rarely in French. Silk and satin
have both been used for printing on in England from the
seventeenth to the nineteenth century. Vellum has also
been largely used for special copies of fine printed books.</p>

<p>A recent French book of prayers is entirely woven in
white and black silk. It looks like a beautifully printed
book with monotone borders.</p>

</div>

<p>An original sheet of paper can
of course be made and cut to any
size, and the terms folio, quarto,
octavo, and duodecimo do not
indicate any actual size except
in bookbinders’ specifications.
The terms only indicate the
number of times the original
sheet has been folded, and this
obviously is a matter which is subject to as much variation
as the printers choose. But fortunately such foldings
do not vary much, and so we may safely mention those
that are most commonly used. There are several ways
of finding this out, the most obvious being to count the
leaves which follow any one letter in the white line at the
bottom of the leaf. This letter is called the “signature.”
If there is an A or A 1 at the bottom of the first leaf, and
when eight leaves have been turned over a B or B 1 appears,
then the book is an octavo, and so on. Another way of
determining the same thing is by means of the direction
taken by the chain or wire marks all over the paper, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
yet another is to be found by studying the position of the
watermark. But neither of these tests are conclusive, and
often enough there are neither chain
marks nor watermarks to be found at
all, and the sheets are not always
rightly or carefully cut, which brings
the watermark all wrong, so the
following notes are only what may be
expected in normal books.</p>

<p>If a piece of paper or page of a book
printed before 1750, and possibly in
later work, be held up to the light,
certain lines may be seen all over it
in a lighter tint than the rest of the
page. These appear as long thick lines crossed at right
angles by short thin ones. The long thicker lines are
known as “chain” lines, and the shorter ones “laid”
lines, and they are of some value when they exist for
helping to determine the “size” of the
book.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 62.</span>&mdash;Fol.</p></div>
</div>

<p>&mdash;Fol. If the original sheet is folded
once it is called a folio, and in this case
the chain marks are perpendicular and
the watermark is in the middle of the
first leaf. In a folio there is one fold,
two leaves or four pages, and nothing to
cut. Most of Caxton’s books are folios
although they are quite small.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_074b.jpg" width="150" height="227" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 63.</span>&mdash;4<sup>o</sup>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>&mdash;4<sup>o</sup> in size. If the once folded sheet be folded again
across the other way we get a gathering with four leaves,
or eight pages, called a quarto. The chain lines are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
horizontal, and the watermark in the middle of the back of
pp. 4 and 5; there are two foldings and two tops of leaves
to be cut.</p>

<p>&mdash;8<sup>o</sup>. If the quarto be again folded we get a gathering
of eight leaves, or 16 pp., called an octavo, which is the
commonest size for English books. In an octavo there are
three foldings, the chain lines are perpendicular, the
watermark is quartered at the tops of pp. 3, 4, 11 and
12, and there are two tops and two fronts to be cut.</p>

<p>The further foldings of 16<sup>o</sup>, 32<sup>o</sup>, and 64<sup>o</sup> are the same
operations carried further, but although such sizes do
exist they are so uncommon that a further description of
them is not necessary.</p>

<p>&mdash;12<sup>o</sup>. In the case of a duodecimo a different initial
folding is followed. The original sheet instead of being
folded once across the middle, as in the case of a folio, is
now folded into three equal divisions. The parallelogram
thus formed is folded across its shorter diameter, and this
again along its longer diameter. There is now a gathering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of twelve leaves, or 24 pp., with four foldings, the chain
marks perpendicular, the watermark halved at the tops of
pp. 3 and 9, and there are two tops and four fronts to
be cut. It is the commonest size of the smaller French
books.</p>

<p>As to sizes, folios run from the great Atlas of Charles II.,
measuring five feet nine inches and a half by three feet two
inches and a half, and requiring eight skins of morocco for its
binding, to the tiny <cite>Galileo a Madame Cristina de Lorena</cite>, 1615,
“imprimé en 1897,” measuring one half by one quarter of
an inch. A folio cannot be recognised by its shape.</p>

<p>The sizes of quartos and octavos are also very varied,
but, roughly speaking, they can be recognised by their
shapes, especially in the case of modern books. A quarto
is generally squarish in outline, nearly as broad as it is
long; an octavo is an elongated rectangle, its breadth considerably
less than its length. A duodecimo is always
much longer than its breadth.</p>

<p>As curiosities, books have been made in many forms,
circular, heart-shaped, octagonal, flower or animal forms,
but they are of small importance, and have been chiefly
made as Christmas cards, valentines, and such ephemeral
publications.</p>

<p>The rules as to quiring of books printed on paper do not
apply to books printed on vellum. Such books are always
folios, and they are generally quired in gatherings of ten
leaves, following the fashion used in the ancient manuscripts,
but, of course, they can equally well be gathered
together in any even number that may be preferred. There
is no rule.</p>

<p>In Europe, until the nineteenth century, paper was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
always made from triturated rags, but the demand for
cheap literature which has become so urgent in recent
years has compelled paper manufacturers to find some
commoner material from which to make their paper.</p>

<p>It is possible that the way out of the difficulty was
suggested by an analysis of Japanese paper. This has
been known here for some time. It is strong, soft, and
valuable for many reasons, and is cheaply made of fibres
from plants of the mulberry tree species. Japanese paper
is hand made and has a certain amount of dressing, its
surface is dull, but takes impressions from engraved plates
or type easily. It appears to last fairly well, but would
probably not stand much wear at the joints.</p>

<p>The idea of using pulped vegetable matter for paper was,
however, not new, even to the Japanese, as there was such
a thing as paper made from papyrus, but it does not seem
to have been much employed, because it was not necessary
in view of the fact that the papyrus did quite well by itself
without any further manipulation.</p>

<p>For reliable papers, the Committee on the Deterioration
of Paper appointed by the Society of Arts in 1898 give in
their report a statement that 70 per cent. should consist of
fibres of cotton, flax, or hemp, but about the middle of the
nineteenth century it was found that passable paper could
be very cheaply made from straw and from esparto grass,
and this paved the way for the disastrous use of mechanical
wood pulp for cheap newspapers and books.</p>

<p>Many sorts of wood pulps are now made for this purpose,
and there is no doubt that the industry of breaking up
wood for the purpose of paper making is a large and
increasing one. In Norway there are several large establishments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
already working at this output. The fibres of
spruce, pine, birch, poplar, jute, and manilla are all
extensively used. The wood is cut up into small pieces and
triturated until it is in a state of fine dissemination, a mass
of small fibres, in which condition it is mixed in certain
proportions with the other materials of which the paper is
to be composed. In spite of the warnings of the Society of
Arts Committee, there is no doubt that the use of
“mechanical” wood pulp for paper is increasing, and this
regardless of the fact that there is no lasting quality in
such material, for the fibres of the wood are invariably
brittle, and they also darken rapidly under the influence of
light.</p>

<p>The dressing of such papers with resin or gelatine effects
a certain improvement; gelatine particularly adds to the
life of a paper and increases the elasticity of the wood
fibres, but this good effect tends to die out in time. Resin
is of less use.</p>

<p>One particularly troublesome result of having to deal
with wood pulp papers is that it will not hold the threads
used in ordinary binding; the thread cuts right through the
paper because of the shortness or brittleness of the fibres,
and if a book printed on such paper has to be bound, the
only safe way to do it is to frame each page in a border of
sound rag paper, and then have it sewn as usual. Wood
paper will not stand bending, but breaks off short if there
is anything like a joint or fold in it, and the framing or
mounting prevents this. The process of mounting every
leaf of a book is, however, a very expensive one; a couple
of pounds may well be spent on a comparatively small
book for this operation alone, so that the prospect before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
owners of libraries who wish to keep their books in good
order is not brilliant. No amount of dressing can make
such paper really strong, as it is the fibres themselves that
are in fault.</p>

<p>But there is another form in which the use of wood is
not so harmful, and in this case the fibres are no longer
there to be found fault with. “Chemical” wood pulp is a
form of cellulose, and it is likely that it is destined to play
an important part in the paper of the future, in conjunction
with fibres of various sorts.</p>

<p>Chemical wood pulp is prepared from the wood fibres by
“digesting” with caustic soda or bisulphide of lime, as
reducing agents. The process is one of much interest, and
moreover a good deal of wood has to be used to make a
comparatively small amount of wood cellulose. Esparto
and straw celluloses are not so good as wood cellulose.</p>

<p>The invention of the “half-tone” process, by which a
dotted block can be produced from a toned drawing, print,
or photograph, can be made, is responsible for much
dangerous procedure with regard to the paper upon which
the prints from the dotted blocks are to be made.</p>

<p>In itself the invention of the half-tone process is a
wonderful and beautiful one, but it has done more to ruin
the already decadent modern paper than anything else, because
it has made the dressing of the paper of greater
importance than the paper itself.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the half-tone block has given the death-blow
to the old and beautiful art of wood engraving, which
is now only found in quite exceptional instances. But the
half-tone block has, nevertheless, provided some small
solace for the dispossessed wood engravers, because the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
soft metal blocks go wrong in light places and themselves
need careful revision with a graver. This touching-up is
so general, and so much technical skill is required for its
proper execution, that it has already become a recognised
profession, and the engraver’s name is often enough recognised
in the lettering of the prints made from such blocks,
especially in American publications.</p>

<p>The dots of half-tone blocks were at first of an easily
visible size, but as the method of production became better
understood it was found that they could be made so small
that they were no longer visible as separate dots to the
unaided vision, but that the effect produced was really that
of a tone-wash.</p>

<p>But the very finely grained blocks were difficult to print
from, the ink stuck too readily between the dots, where it
was not wanted, and the surface of the paper was not even
enough to give a clear impression, even if it was calendered
and super-calendered. So something had to be done to
give the paper a more level surface, and the needed
material was found in china clay mixed more or less with
barytes. It is laid down in the <cite>Society of Arts Report</cite> that
the amount of this dressing should in no case exceed 10
per cent. in any paper, but modern “art” papers have
for a long time much exceeded this fair proportion.</p>

<p>From the beginning some kind of dressing has always
been found necessary in the manufacture of paper, but
nothing so dangerous as china clay has ever been used.
The net result is that almost all modern editions-de-luxe,
and fine illustrated books generally, either having half-tone
plates or colour plates done by the three colour process,
consist of little else but thin sheets of china clay supported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
by the smallest possible skeleton of wood or other cheap
fibres.</p>

<p>It must be at once granted that the impressions from
delicate half-tone blocks made on clay paper are admirable,
and it is also true that the printing ink makes the clay
insoluble in water wherever it touches it. But the clay has
a certain affinity for damp, and books printed on clay
paper very readily show damp stains, and if left for any
time in a really damp place they are liable to become solid
bricks of white mud, quite impossible to repair.</p>

<p>If very dry the non-cohesive clay will turn to a white
powder. Moreover, this clay-laden paper will not hold
binding threads, so again it has to be preserved. A book
printed on such material has to be treated in the same
way as I have described in the case of wood pulp paper.</p>

<p>There is, however, a plan of preserving prints on clay,
and this is to fasten down the printed portion on a piece of
sound paper from the beginning. This is already done to
some extent, and it should be universal in the case of
isolated plates, but when a book is all printed on clay paper,
as many fine and valuable books unfortunately are, it is
difficult to say what is best to be done. The only real
remedy seems to be a refusal on the part of purchasers to
buy such books. But purchasers do not always know when
they are buying clay instead of paper. It is, however, not
difficult to tell, as the clay-laden paper feels very smooth
and soft to the touch of a dry finger. This peculiarity can
be easily detected in one or other of the American magazines,
Harper’s or Scribner’s, and the difference between
the feel of a page holding an impression from a fine half-tone
block, and that having only text, will at once be evident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>If a mark may be made on a suspected sheet, a drop
of water should be put upon one corner, left a second or
two, and then dried off with blotting-paper. Now a light
scrape with a knife over the damped place will remove a
layer of white clay if it is there.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the large majority of our modern
books will not be in readable condition in about a hundred
years’ time from the date of their publishing.</p>

<span class="titlefont">PRINTING.</span></h2>


<p class="chapblock">Assyrian bricks, with printed inscriptions&mdash;Oiron ware&mdash;Chinese
types&mdash;Block books&mdash;Costeriana&mdash;Types and stereotypes&mdash;Printing
presses.</p>

<p>There are numbers of instances of impressions from
small devices, cyphers and letterings cut on blocks of wood
or soft metal and made on pieces of pottery. These stamps
are the forerunners of the types with which our modern
books are printed. Among these impressions those which are
made on the tablets or
cylinders of baked clay,
many of which have
been found among the
ruins of Babylon and
Nineveh, are by far the
earliest. They are covered
with inscriptions printed
in cuneiform characters,
and contain records of sales of slaves, loans of money, sales
of land and the like, and on the larger bricks and cylinders
are longer inscriptions of greater interest, among them
stories of the Flood. Many of these records are contained
within an outer shell of the same shape, in which is either
a short title with seal or even a duplicate inscription. These
outer cases are the earliest examples of anything in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
shape of a cover or binding over written or printed matter.
Some of the cuneiform bricks are said to date from the
third thousand years <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and many of the later examples
belonged to the libraries of Sennacherib and Ashurhani-Pal,
Kings of Assyria.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 66.</span>&mdash;Assyrian tablet of clay,

With outer case.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Similar bricks, impressed with inscriptions, have been
found in North America. The letters on these bricks,
tablets, or cylinders were printed letter by letter by hand
upon the clay when it was wet and soft, without ink, then
the brick was dried either in an oven or in the sun, so
that this earliest method of printing is diametrically opposite
to the modern process, in which case the letters are
inked and kept rigid, while the paper or other substance on
which the impression is to come is lightly pressed upon
them.</p>

<p>In the eleventh century the Chinese made types of clay
or porcelain, and set them up in a frame and printed from
them, and afterwards they cut the original types in wood
and made impressions, or stereotypes from them in porcelain,
and when this had been baked they cast leaden
types from it. Chinese and Japanese letters are always
most decorative, whether in the cursive or square seal
characters.</p>

<p>Babylonian and Assyrian tablets, cylinders, and cones of
baked clay impressed with cuneiform inscriptions have
proved themselves to be the most permanent and reliable
form of record that has yet been invented by mankind.
The hammer alone seems to be able to destroy them.</p>

<p>The most precious faience in the world is that variously
known as “Oiron,” “Henri Deux,” “Diane de Poictiers,”
or “Faience de Saint Porchaire.” There are fewer than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
seventy pieces of this ware known, and each example is a
masterpiece, no two being alike.</p>

<p>It is said to consist mainly of clay found at Saint Porchaire,
a village in Poiton, and not far from Oiron, and at
one of these places it was probably made.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_087.jpg" width="600" height="205" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 67.</span>&mdash;Italian book stamps impressed upon the faience de
St. Porchaire.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The pieces are often ornamented with armorials and
devices of Francis I., Henri II., and Diane de Poictiers,
as well as those of members of the French nobility of about
the middle of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>There are jugs, covered cups, biberons, dishes, salts,
flower vases, and candlesticks, all curiously put together in
sections, and ornamented with impressions from binders’
stamps run in with differently coloured clays.</p>

<p>This use of binders’ stamps is unique, and has been made
with the utmost skill and taste. Sometimes casts have
been made from the stamps so that the impression shows
in reversed colours. The ornamentation is like a book-finisher’s
work, and several of the same stamps and rolls
show on contemporary Italian bookbindings. At that time
there was a strong Italian influence both in French as well
as in English decorative bookbindings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>It has already been supposed that the ware may have
been sent as a present to Henri II. from the family of
Catherine de Medici, and M. H. Delange even goes so far as
to credit Girolamo della Robbia with the work. He, as well
as many other Florentine craftsmen, worked in France for
Francis I.</p>

<p>It is not now likely that any definite knowledge as to the
maker of the Saint Porchaire Faience will ever be obtained,
but it will always be a notable example of the high decorative
importance of binders’ stamps, which are designed
upon certain principles, especially with regard to their
combination in groups or lines of groups.</p>

<p>Attempts to imitate this ware have often been made, but
so far they have failed; the original seems to possess
qualities and peculiarities that are impossible to imitate
closely. Art forgeries are now so common and so excellent
that there are really very few things that cannot be copied
so exactly that it is difficult to distinguish between the
original and the copy, but the Saint Porchaire ware is so
far one of the very few things that completely baffle the
cleverest artist, and this is largely due to the curious use of
the binders’ stamps.</p>

<p>Engraved wooden blocks were used in China, Corea, and
Japan as early as the sixth century, and quite likely long
before. These blocks were cut in the same manner as the
European block books, except that type and illustrations
were not shown on the same block. In Thibet similar
blocks were cut and charms were printed from them.</p>

<p>The use of separately engraved types which could be
arranged as desired seems to have been known in these
countries at about the same time, but it was not so suitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
to their then requirements, and so it made no headway.
They soon reverted to the simple block engraving as better.
No doubt the reason of this was that the number of
separate letters that might be required was so great that it
was practically prohibitive. The letters both in China and
Japan are still mainly in the syllabic stage, and so there
are a great number of them. The alphabetical stage is,
however, gradually being reached, especially in Japan.</p>

<p>It is very likely that the European idea of cutting block
books was borrowed from China, and here from the later
half of the fifteenth century until the earlier half of the
sixteenth century such books were produced plentifully in
Germany, Holland, and England, and more rarely in
France.</p>

<p>Single-sheet pictures were made at first, the earliest dated
example known being the “St. Christopher” of 1423, now
in the Rylands Library in Manchester. From being cut on
wood these curious prints are generally known as xylographs.
Criticism and comparison of them is a very
difficult matter, as they were designed and cut on such
broad and easy lines that they were easily copied almost
exactly, but now all the important and very early specimens
are so well known and have been so carefully listed and
described by competent bibliographers like Mr. Gordon
Duff, Sir Martin Conway, Hain, Ottley, Bradshaw, Hessels,
Proctor, and others, that there is little risk of fraudulent
imitation remaining long unrecognised.</p>

<p>The block book proper however, shows text as well as
illustrations, the text gradually becoming more and
more important. Block books are printed in pale coloured
ink, so that they may take colour as well as possible, and are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
usually coloured more or less, sometimes by hand and sometimes
by means of stencil plates, or perhaps a combination
of both methods. Many of them are astronomical, but as a
rule the subjects are more or less religious, such as the “Ars
Moriendi” or “Biblia Pauperum”; the illustrations and
the text being variously arranged. Each page is cut on
one block, sometimes printed page by page, sometimes two
pages at a time, and always on one side of the paper only.</p>

<p>Now and then, as in the case of the “Speculum <a id="Ref_90"></a>Humanae
Salvationis,” the text is separately cut; this remarkable
book is supposed to have been printed at Utrecht about
1470-72. Block books are always printed on paper of
excellent quality.</p>

<p>Printing from moveable types in Europe is considered by
many authorities to have been invented by Laurens Janszoon
Coster, of Haarlem, during the earlier half of the fifteenth
century. Actual proofs are wanting, but there exist several
books and fragments of books, many of which have been
recovered from the boards of old bindings, which certainly
are not the work of Gutenberg. These fragments were
printed in Holland, and are known as “Costeriana”;
several of the letters used correspond to the Dutch manuscript
letters of the time, and many of them are copies of the school
books known as “Donatus’.” Some of the letters look much
as if they had been cut in wood. At Avignon it is recorded
that in 1444 experiments with printing types were made.</p>

<p>The Coster legend appears to have been started by
Adrianus Junius, who in his <cite>Batavia</cite>, published at Antwerp
in 1588, speaking of Haarlem, says: “Redeo ad
urbem nostram cui primam inventae ist hic artis typographical
gloriam deberi.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no doubt that the Costeriana have a family
likeness between them, and the types used in them have
been carefully compared by Mr. Hessels with those found
in the edition of Ælius Donatus’ grammars, and in the
<cite>Doctrinale</cite> of Alex. de Villa Dei, and in his opinion they
have the same origin.</p>

<p>Whether the rival claims of Avignon, Haarlem, or Mainz,
for the honour of having been the first town in which
printing from moveable types was done in Europe will ever
be finally settled, is questionable. But there is no doubt
that Johann Gutenberg was the first printer in Europe who
made printing with moveable type of real usefulness. In
1472, Fichet wrote that Gutenberg, who worked in Mayence,
was the first inventor of the art of printing by means of
moveable types. Curiously enough the work credited to him
shows no amateur feeling whatever. Both the Indulgences
of 1454, which may be his, and the Mazarin Bible of about
1455, which certainly is, are as finely and perfectly printed
as any books ever have been since.</p>

<p>It must be noted here that certain authorities still maintain
that this Bible was printed by Fust and Schöffer, but the
weight of expert opinion is nevertheless strongly in favour
of Gutenberg.</p>

<p>But however this may be, in the case of the beautiful Mainz
Psalter, we are on absolutely safe ground. In this book
appears the date 1457, and also the names of the printers
Johann Fust and Peter Schöffer. It is in every way a
magnificent specimen of typography, and the letters are
very large. It is also a fine example of colour printing, as
the initial letters are cut in wood and printed in red and
blue. Peter Schöffer was originally an illuminator of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
manuscripts, and no doubt we owe the splendid initials of
the Mainz Psalter to his liking for colour.</p>

<p>The first printed date in a Dutch book is 1473, when
books were printed both at Utrecht and Alost.</p>

<p>The moment separate letters were cut in wood for the
purpose of printing, it must have been obvious to any workman
interested in the matter that it would be far better to
use them as models only, and that for actual use casts in
soft metal would be more economical. In J. E. Hodgkin’s
“<cite>Rariora</cite>” there is an excellent detailed account of the
manner in which types are cast.</p>

<p>At first the method of casting type was probably much
the same as it is now, except that it was done slowly by
hand instead of quickly by machines. The matrix was set
at the bottom of a short funnel in a little hand press. This
press was held in the left hand, funnel upwards, then a
little melted metal was run in from a ladle held in the right
hand. The metal set almost immediately, and the little
letter was jerked out, to be trimmed by hand. What the
earliest metal used for types was cannot now be known for
certain, but it was probably much the same as is now used,
lead with tin and antimony, and perhaps a little copper&mdash;a
composition which expands in cooling. By this hand process
a good workman could produce two or three thousand
letters in a day.</p>

<p>Now things are managed differently, and there are several
automatic machines which not only save the handwork of a
type caster, but do the work equally well and at a much
greater speed.</p>

<p>For the casting of separate letters the Wick Rotary type
casting machine is perhaps one of the most ingenious. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
consists of a horizontal wheel with radiating channels in
which the matrices of the various letters are set. The
wheel revolves, and as the opening of each little channel
reaches a certain point a jet of type metal is driven into it
and forms a letter. A little more revolution and the letter
is automatically ejected and caught on an endless chain.
This machine is capable of producing 50,000 letters in an
hour.</p>

<p>The monotype is, however, even a cleverer invention
because it only casts the particular letter that is wanted.
An operator translates the manuscript, by means of a key-board,
into a series of holes on a strip of paper. This strip
then moves on to the monotype machine, which not only
casts the letter indicated by each hole, but puts it in its
proper place, and jerks it forward until one line is complete.
On the completion of a line the machine has a
spasm, and the line is driven bodily upwards, leaving a
space for the next line. This is probably the printing
machine of the future, as it only requires the one operator,
who translates the manuscript into dots.</p>

<p>The methods used in the Linotype and the Monoline are
somewhat similar, and effected by the use of a key-board,
but instead of casting each letter, like the monotype, they
cast complete lines, which are more troublesome to correct
if any mistake creeps in.</p>

<p>When the printing press was first used is not known,
but the printing of the block books would no doubt have
suggested some sort of board press long before types were
used in Europe. A block book might be printed by hand only,
but it would be a troublesome and laborious process, and
the use of a flat padded board to put over the whole block<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and press upon it seems obvious enough, and the screw
press evolved itself out of some such expedient. The
familiar napkin press with a large wooden screw and cross
handle is the type of the earliest printing presses of which
we possess any record, the screw presently giving way
before the more effective lever
handles, and it should not be
forgotten that excellent results
can be obtained from these old
presses acting with a direct
downward pressure. They are,
however, very slow in action,
and that is not consistent with
modern requirements.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 68.</span>&mdash;Printing press
of about 1600. From
Stradanus.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Dutch were the pioneers
in improvements in these
presses, and W. J. Blaew, of
Amsterdam, a clever engraver,
printer, and mechanician of
the seventeenth century, made
several improvements in many
of the details, especially as
regards the box, table, or forme,
in which the type was set. But
until Charles, third Earl Stanhope, invented the iron
printing press with levers, in 1800, they were always made
of wood, with screw handles.</p>

<p>Lord Stanhope was a most remarkable man. He was not
only an ardent politician but also a notable man of science
and an inventor. Among other things we owe to him the
Stanhope lens; a system of logotypes, which was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
received by the printing trade with much sympathy,
because it lessened the need for hand labour, improvements
in stereotyping, and above all the Stanhope press, which
would have made a fortune for its inventor if he had wanted
it. Lord Stanhope, however, gave his press to the Clarendon
Press at Oxford, in exchange for a pension to his assistant.
This press with its levers was for a long time the model for
all printing presses used in this country.</p>

<p>But before the Stanhope press was invented, W. Nicholson,
of London, had patented, in 1790, a device which was
destined to supersede Lord Stanhope’s lever press and all
others like it. This was the use of a revolving iron cylinder
driven by steam to carry the paper over the inked surface of
the type. Nicholson’s invention fell flat so long as it
remained in his hands, but in about 1807 it was taken up
by Koenig, of London, improved, and put upon the market,
and it attracted the attention of Mr. Walter, of <cite>The Times</cite>.</p>

<p>In the issue of this paper on the 20th of November, 1814,
readers were informed that it was printed by steam
machinery driving the cylinders holding the paper. By
cylinder presses upwards of 9,600 impressions can be made
in an hour. Minor improvements since that time have been
legion, and it may safely be said that no more wonderful
sight is to be seen in the whole of London than the printing
of one of our great daily papers.</p>

<p>Newspapers are usually printed from stereotypes fixed on
cylinders; but books are always printed from <em>flat</em> formes,
the paper being applied by cylinders. Paper can now be
printed on both sides simultaneously. In Rotary machines
both the printing as well as the receiving surfaces are
arranged on cylinders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>The locking up of type in the case of long books was
soon found to be a great inconvenience, and the idea of
making a cast of such type in the form of a block, so as to
set the original type free, was an obvious one. It was not,
however, put into practical form until the early part of the
nineteenth century, when someone unknown made casts from
book types in plaster of Paris. Lord Stanhope made several
improvements in this, and it is possible that the use of
softened paper pulp&mdash;flong&mdash;for this purpose was his invention.
Whether this is true or not, paper was certainly
used for stereotyping in France about 1850, and it has
been universally used in this important connection ever
since.</p>

<p>The paper pulp is hammered on to the type by means of
a hard brush, in exactly the same way that antiquaries
make impressions from incised rock sculptures. The
antiquaries, however, make their casts from the paper
moulds in plaster of Paris, but the printer makes his in
soft metal.</p>

<p>When the paper mould is properly dry and hard the
melted metal is poured over it, and makes a perfect cast.
Such casts can either be used flat for book printing, or
curved to fix on cylinders for newspaper printing. The
metal used is practically the same as type metal. It sets
very quickly, and the heat necessary to melt it is so low,
that several casts can be made from one paper mould.</p>

<p>Another way of making a harder printing plate is by
means of a galvanic battery. In this case the mould from
the type is made in wax, either impregnated or carefully
dusted with black lead, and these moulds, when correct, are
put into a galvanic bath, where a strong metallic deposit is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
laid all over them, the deposit being afterwards backed up
with alloy.</p>

<p>Good types have always been difficult to design. The
types used in block books, and in early printed books generally,
were simply copies of the handwriting of the periods
to which they belonged. Even in later and in modern
times certain founts have been designed on the lines of
cheirographic writing, for example, the “caractères de
civilité,” much liked by French printers, imitated the
graceful calligraphy of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>But a certain differentiation in the direction of squareness
soon became apparent, as we have already noticed
in the case of rock inscriptions; it was found easier to
cut squarely-shaped letters than rounded or cursive
forms.</p>

<p>So letters cut for the purpose of being printed tended
gradually to differentiate themselves from their written
analogues, and a new kind of designing came into existence.
It was, however, always necessary to preserve as
much of the original form of the letters as possible, otherwise
they might fail to be recognised.</p>

<p>Printers have always liked to show their types, and from
the catalogue printed by Schöffer about 1469 to Caslon’s
eighteenth century specimens, there have been numbers of
them made and issued. A short study of these specimens
will show, firstly, how very much they are copied one from
another, and secondly, that no designer of genius seems
ever to have appeared. All that can be said is that some
are uglier than others. It has not been for want of trying,
as Geoffrey Tory shows in his <cite>Champfleury</cite>, but, except
as to Greek types, in which Robert Procter has, by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
counsel, met with much success, there is no doubt that
good types for printing are rare.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century P. E. Fournier caused much
improvement in French types, both by his example and his
writings. He was the son of a typefounder, and began as
a wood engraver, but eventually followed in his father’s
footsteps and became a typefounder himself. Fournier
published a table of types in 1737, with suggestions for
designing them, but his most important work is the <cite>Manuel
typographique</cite>, which is an important work on the subject,
and had widespread influence.</p>

<p>In the matter of facsimiles of early printed books, it may
be well here to say a word or two of warning. Photography
has revolutionised many things, it has destroyed some of
the minor arts, but in book production it has had far-reaching
effect, much of which is good.</p>

<p>It has also opened up several new industries, and now
photo-lithographs, collotypes, half-tone blocks, and prints
from line blocks made by the swelled gelatine or other
processes, can be so wonderfully like the original, that a
page of old printing made by one or other of these methods
will often deceive an ordinary purchaser. There are many
such facsimiles in the market, and the best advice I can give
as to them is that very great attention should be given to
the <em>paper</em> on which they are done, as this will often give
the secret away. The texture and appearance of old paper
is worthy of careful study, because nearly all the photo-mechanical
processes need a paper which is radically
different to the thick good rag-made papers which were
used before cheap modern papers were thought of.</p>

<p>Type founding in England was first carried on in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
sixteenth century, when John Day made some Anglo-Saxon
types for Archbishop Parker.</p>

<p>Moxon, who wrote the “Mechanics of Printing” in 1693,
issued the first English specimen sheet of types in 1669,
and in 1776 William Caslon, “Letter-founder of London,”
issued a specimen of his printing types.</p>

</div>

<p>John Baskerville, who lived and worked about the same
period, was also a very eminent typefounder, but Baskerville’s
types were too thin in the up-strokes to be considered
equal to Caslon’s. Since that time such sheets of types
have become common.</p>

<p>Late in the nineteenth century William Morris revived
several of the old English block-letter types, and called
them by the old names, “Chaucer,” “Golden,” “Troy.”</p>

<p>Writing in early manuscripts was continuous, no stops,
no spaces, no initials. The inconvenience of such an
arrangement soon became apparent; the effect of it can be
well seen in the case of the <cite>Codex Alexandrinus</cite>, written in
the fifth century, although this has large initials, and the
difficulty of knowing when a word ends is bad enough, to
say nothing of sentences. The manuscript is at the
British Museum.</p>

<p>Presently the first letters of sentences, or perhaps of
important words, were enlarged or rubricated&mdash;marked in
red&mdash;and from that starting point came the gradual development
of beautiful ornamental letters with sprays starting
from them. These sprays ultimately became rich borderings
and spread all over the page, and at last we get to the
illuminated manuscripts of mediæval times filled with
exquisite miniatures, borders, and arabesques of all imaginable
kinds.</p>

<p>The subject of illuminated manuscripts has been fully
dealt with by several competent authorities, and it is not
necessary here to enter into it, but so far as printed books
are concerned it will be of interest to survey shortly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
chief styles of illustrations with which they have been
provided.</p>

<p>When printed books first began there were no illustrations
in them, but initial letters were often added in red, by
hand, and other important printed letters were marked by
a dab of red or yellow across them. The outline wood
cuts which shortly made their appearance were frequently
intended to serve as guides for hand colouring, and many
of them are so treated.</p>

<p>Wood cutting in the case of block books was well understood
in the fifteenth century, but when similar illustrations
appear, in company with the text, in early printed
books, the art level both of the designer and wood cutter is
singularly low. This criticism only applies to the pictorial
illustrations, as in the matter of scroll work or ornamental
initials the work is excellent.</p>

<p>The great letter “B” in Fust and Schöffer’s <cite>Mainz
Psalter</cite>, issued in 1457, is as fine as anything of its kind
that has ever been done. It is printed from two wood
blocks which fit into each other, and which were inked
alternately either red or blue, and then printed together
with the text. A slow process but thoroughly effective.
The initial letters throughout this book seem to have
been touched up in places by hand, especially in the long
scrolls which meander up and down the margins of the
pages.</p>

<p>The earliest known book illustration cut on wood is a
beautiful outline sketch of the Goddess of Mercy. It is
full page and illustrates a chapter from a Chinese version
of the Saddharmapundarika Sutra, and was printed in
1331, nearly a hundred years before the earliest European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
print from a wood block, the St. Christopher, of 1423,
which moreover was not a book illustration.</p>

<p>Chinese, Japanese, and Korean wood cuts are always in
outline, thickened here and there, but quite different in
character and far better in drawing and execution than
early European work of the same sort. Most of the blocks
from which these prints are made are of soft wood, not
box, and are cut with a short knife of peculiar form set in
a handle.</p>

<p>The drawings are made on thin paper and stuck downwards
on the blocks; then the knife is carefully run along
the edges of the various lines, cutting outwards, the interlinear
spaces being cut away with a gouge and hammer.
The wood cutting was often done by women. The method
of work is probably the same as was used in Europe in the
case of early blocks.</p>

<p>Besides the design block, always printed in dark neutral
tint or black, during the eighteenth and succeeding
centuries, the Chinese and Japanese cut accessory blocks
which were inked in various colours. The registering of
the various colour blocks was managed either by pegs or
notches, and the colours were mixed with water or rice
paste. Most of the European colour processes of printing
require oil colours, but water colours on the Japanese
principle have been used with admirable effect in some of the
illustrations to Henry Shaw’s books on Mediæval Dresses
and Decorative Arts, and notably by Edmund Evans
and his successors in more recent times.</p>

<p>From the earliest illustration, mentioned above, until
the present day, the style of Chinese and Japanese wood
illustrations has not altered. There have been several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
engravers of great skill in both countries, but I think the
Japanese colour prints are best known to us.</p>

<p>The blocks are frequently signed with the names of the
designers, particularly in later times, and many names are
already well known to collectors.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century Korin was one of the best of
the Japanese illustrators; in the eighteenth century there
is admirable work signed by Hokusai and Hiroshige, and
among the many skilled designers of the nineteenth
century the work of Kitigawa Utamaro is perhaps the best
known.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Page from the “Hypnerotomachia Poliphili.”
(<em>Venice</em>, 1499.) [<em>To face p.</em> 104.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The first Italian book in which wood engravings were
used is, as far as is now known, the “Meditations” of
Turrecremata, printed at Rome in 1467, by Ulrich Hahn.
The illustrations are of a simple character in outline.
Then came instances in books printed at Naples, Rome,
Verona, and especially at Venice, where Erhard Ratdolt
produced several with beautiful initials, borders, and
pictures. Numbers of the books published at Venice in the
later part of the fifteenth century are illustrated with
exquisite wood cuts; among them the most celebrated
and the most beautiful is the <cite>Hypnerotomachia Poliphili</cite>,
printed in 1499.</p>

<p>This celebrated book was written by Francesco Colonna,
whose name is curiously shown by the initials of the
chapters, which read “Poliam Frater Franciscus Columna
peramavit,” “Brother Franciscus Columna loved Polia
very much.” Polia has been presumably identified with
Lucretia Lelio, who was a native of Treviso, the place of
Polifilo’s dream. The many engravings are in outline,
and several of them are full page.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Italians have always excelled in wood cutting, but
although there have been numbers of illustrated books
issued in the sixteenth and later centuries, those of the
fifteenth century still remain pre-eminent. Dr. Paul
Kristeller has, moreover, shown that the Italian printers
devices are well worthy of attention, and many of them
are very fine both in design and execution.</p>

<p>Block books, Japanese wood blocks, and all very early wood
cuts, were cut by a knife, and such outline work, not too
small, is easier to execute with a properly shaped knife
than with anything else. But as soon as wood cutters
began to be more skilled, and compared their work with
line engraving, they found that a knife was not so
useful as an engraver’s burin, and so wood <em>engraving</em>,
as distinct from <em>cutting</em>, came into being. The cuts in
the <cite>Nuremberg Chronicle</cite> of 1493 show some sort of a
transitional stage; there are hatchings and shadowings
which would have been much more easily done with a
graver than with a knife, but I believe, nevertheless, they
are all knife work.</p>

<p>Roughly speaking, it is easier to cut a broad outline
drawing with a knife than with a graver, and it is easier to
cut a small detail drawing with a graver than with a knife.
At the same time we must remember that a skilled engraver
could execute either sort of engraving in the wrong way,
just as William Harvey cut his well known wood blocks of
the Death of Dentatus in such a way as to show every
technical peculiarity, except one, of an engraving on metal.</p>

<p>Both wood blocks and metal blocks intended to illustrate
printed books were always made of the same depth as the
type, so that they could all be printed together, and that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
done to-day in the case of process or half-tone blocks, which
are actually wooden blocks faced with the soft metal bearing
the design. There is always some interest in the question
as to whether a certain print has been cut on a wood block
or on a metal block, and if the print is in perfect condition it
is a very difficult matter to decide. But it is rarely that
some small defect or peculiarity does not appear by help
of which a tolerably certain judgment can be arrived at.
Early engraved blocks were often used again and again
until they became quite old, and at last they were got at by
insects who ate small holes in them. If therefore a print
shows little white circular marks upon it there is no doubt
that it was made from a wood block. Instances are by no
means unknown in which experts have decided that a
certain block had been cut on metal, and a later impression
has turned up <em>with worm holes in it</em>! The grain of wood
will sometimes show on an old print, or a broken edge will
show a sharp fracture indicating wood, in contradistinction
to a rounded one, indicating metal.</p>

<p>The blacks on prints from an engraved metal plate always
show very even spaces, and there are usually plenty of them,
often broken, however, by small white dots, the presence of
which denotes the style known as Pointille, the finest
examples of which can be found among the French Horæ
printed for Pigouchet in the fifteenth century. The metal
used was probably a sort of pewter, lead and tin, very easy to
engrave upon, and strong enough to bear many printings.
But in many instances these little blocks seem to have been
roughly treated and have fallen about, and the result is
that outer lines which show perfectly straight in early
copies, show as slightly rounded lines on late ones. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
is taken as a decided proof that the original block was made
of soft metal, although I am by no means certain that it is
impossible for a straight edge on wood to warp into a
curved line.</p>

<p>Prints from old wood cuts in outlines were frequently
added to early printed books and painted over thickly with
opaque colour so as to produce a different design. The
original outline has only been used as a slight guide.
Instances of these curious changes can be found in numbers
of the fine vellum books illustrated in colour which were
printed for Antoine Vérard at Paris in the fifteenth
century.</p>

<p>In other cases, particularly in Italy and France, ornamental
printed borders and illustrations have been very
carefully painted by hand just as if they belonged to
ordinary illuminated manuscripts. But the art work in all
these cases is not good. The true <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">illuminatores</i> were
obsolescent. A few instances of attempts at colour printing
either by means of blocks or stencil plates were made by
Erhard Ratdolt at Venice, and a few others.</p>

<p>There are two distinct schools of wood engraving, and
they are easily recognised from each other whenever either
of them is exclusively new, but the large majority of the
more recent book illustrations cut on wood show traces of
both styles.</p>

<p>These styles are firstly that of the black line, the type of
which may be found in Caxton’s <cite>Myrrour of the Worlde</cite>
printed in 1481, and secondly that of the white line, the best
type of which may be found in the <cite>History of British Birds</cite>,
illustrated with engravings by Thomas Bewick in 1797.</p>

[<em>To face p.</em> 108.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In judging whether an illustration in a book is printed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
from a block cut and printed in the manner of a wood block,
the first thing to observe is whether the black lines are
pressed into the paper or not. The amount of the depression
of the black lines may be very slight, but it must
always be looked for because although the necessary
pressure for printing from type and block is slight, still
there is always some of it, and before the introduction of
the modern clay-laden papers, the paper used for printing
upon was always softened by damp, and consequently very
susceptible to pressure. If the depression of the black lines
can be recognised, the print is made from a block of some
sort, and printed with a slight pressure.</p>

<p>William Blake’s curious illustrated poems are exceptions
to any rule. He was very poor and unable to afford to
have his writings properly published, so he wrote and drew
them out himself on copper, and then etched away the
ground very strongly so as to leave his lines in relief. The
plates were then printed as relief blocks. As curiosities
they are of great interest, and they preserve the individual
touch of the artist to just about the same extent as an
etching does. The process is exactly analogous to the
manner in which names or designs are etched on sword
blades, key rings, knife blades and the like, only Blake
allowed the acid to work a little more strongly so as to get
a slightly higher relief.</p>

<p>The first English printed book that is illustrated is
Caxton’s <cite>Myrrour of the Worlde</cite>, printed in 1481; the cuts
are quite elementary in character, like all the wood cuts in
English books for a long time. Ornamental borders are
found in Caxton’s <cite>Fifteen Oes.</cite>, printed about 1490.</p>

<p>Early English books were not freely illustrated, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
must be supposed that wood cutters were scarce. Many of
the cuts used are of foreign origin. One early book is
charmingly illustrated in colour; Dame Juliana Bernes’
so-called <cite>Book of St. Albans</cite>, printed in 1486, has a long series
of coats-of-arms printed from wood blocks. The colour has
been added either from other blocks separately inked or
else by means of stencil plates.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century wood illustrations became more
numerous, but many of them were still of foreign
workmanship.</p>

<p>Borders and designs by Holbein were used by Pynson,
and these had a renaissance feeling which was quite
foreign to the existing style. The mixed style which
consequently made its appearance is very curious. It
shows well in the semi-classical device of Lucretia used by
Thomas Berthelet, royal printer to Henry VIII. Towards
the end of the century there were several large volumes
of chronicles published in England, Halle, Grafton and
Holinshed, and these and similar volumes are all well
illustrated with wood cuts. Foxe’s “Book of Martyrs,” published
in 1563 by John Day, is also an example of a well
illustrated and popular book, the cuts in which were all
probably made here.</p>

“History of British Birds.” (<em>Newcastle</em>, 1797-1804.)
[<em>To face p.</em> 110.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Wood engravings in England gave way gradually in the
seventeenth and the earlier half of the eighteenth centuries
before the advancing tide of line engraving, but in the latter
half of the eighteenth century Thomas Bewick came to give
it a new impetus. Bewick’s style was quite original, and
although his particular “white line” style, good as it was,
does not ever seem to have retained any hold upon the
mass of engravers, yet somehow or other we find that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
revival of wood cutting, both here and abroad, is generally
put down to his influence.</p>

<p>Bewick worked on an entirely different principle to that
of any of his predecessors. He gave up imitating the black
line of the metal engraver and used the white line to gain
his effects. No doubt this is the true theory of wood
engraving. Bewick took several apprentices, many of
whom afterwards became famous, but, curiously enough,
none of them kept long to their master’s style. In modern
days Timothy Cole has revived the use of the white line;
his work is most excellent and learned in every way. I
have never found a wrong line in it, and if Bewick had not
shown the way, and therefore put Mr. Cole in the position
of a follower, the latter would have ranked as the greatest
master who has ever worked on wood on the white line
principle.</p>

<p>William Harvey was one of Bewick’s apprentices; he did
an immense quantity of work, which is always excellent.
He soon gave up Bewick’s “white line,” and most of his
wood engravings are like line engravings on copper. The
engraving of the Death of Dentatus, after B. R. Haydon, is
Harvey’s most celebrated piece of work. It shows every
appearance and characteristic of a line engraving, but the
black marks are in intaglio. It is a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tour de force</i>, and
cannot but be considered as a waste of energy. It was
engraved upon several blocks clamped together by an
iron band, and prints of it can now and then be picked up
at printsellers for two or three shillings, as it is seldom
recognised as a wood engraving.</p>

<p>Luke Clennell also worked with and helped Bewick, and
much of his early work is like that of his master. But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
like Harvey, Clennell soon evolved a style of his own. He
cut some of the beautiful little cuts, after Stothard, in
Rogers’ “Pleasures of Memory.” No doubt the Bewick
training had much influence for good over Clennell’s
manner.</p>

<p>Charlton Nesbit followed Bewick closely for a time, and
then, like his fellow apprentices, he worked out his own style.
His work is very good and true, and he was particularly
successful in his illustrations to Northcote’s <cite>Fables</cite> and
<cite>Rinaldo and Armida</cite>.</p>

<p>John Thompson was quite one of our greatest wood
engravers. He worked well into the nineteenth century,
and did an immense quantity of work. He engraved a
celebrated set of illustrations to the <cite>Vicar of Wakefield</cite>,
after Mulready, and was also very successful with those to
Tasso’s <cite>La Gerusalemme Liberata</cite> in 1826. His work is quite
different from that of Bewick.</p>

<p>The nineteenth century in England was rich in numbers
of excellent wood engravers, and a list of their names alone
would be a long one. A proof of the high estimation in
which the work of many of these artists was held is to be
found in the fact that their services as engravers were
freely sought by continental publishers of finely illustrated
books.</p>

<p>J. B. Jackson, who introduced tone colour-printing,
actually worked with J. M. Papillon in France in the
eighteenth century. Then there were the Landells, Gray,
Whimper, Wright, Folkard, and Green, and, quite late in
the century, J. W. Whymper, Horace Harral, James Cooper,
W. J. Linton, the Dalziels, and Swain. These two last
have signed an immense quantity of excellent work, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
they were large firms, and the greater part of their work
was done by their workmen. Many of the artists of this
time did most excellent work as designers for wood
engravings, especially Sir John Millais, D. G. Rossetti,
Fred. Walker, Fred. Sandys, Lord Leighton, Birket Foster,
Sir E. Burne-Jones, G. du Maurier, and Cecil Lawson.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 69.</span>&mdash;Knife for engraving
on soft wood.</p></div>
</div>

<p>J. M. Papillon, who worked during the earlier half of the
eighteenth century, belonged to a French family of wood
engravers, and wrote a treatise about wood-cutting with the
knife, which is of great interest. His work is small and
excellent. Papillon makes mention of a foreigner who
worked with him and used the <em>end</em> of the wood to work
upon, and that he used a graver.
This foreigner is supposed to
have been the English artist
J. B. Jackson, who was eminent
here not only as an engraver,
but also as the pioneer in the matter of colour-printing from
wood blocks.</p>

<p>No doubt up to about the beginning of the eighteenth
century wood cuts had been made on planed pieces of pear
or other soft wood cut lengthways. The grain upon such a
piece of wood necessitating the use of a knife to cut it, the
knife may be a single blade or a double blade of the kind
known as a “scrive,” but it cannot be cut with a solid
graver.</p>

<p>It is possible enough that to Jackson we owe the idea of
making engravings on the cross-cut of a piece of wood, and
if so he is entitled to great honour, as all wood work since
his time has been done in that way. The graver had long
been used on metal, but until the device of cutting blocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
across the grain of a hard wood was thought of it could not
be used on wood. Hard wood was now wanted with as
little grain as possible, and box is the ideal.</p>

<p>In the nineteenth century much excellent wood engraving
was done in France. Indeed, after a period of practical
non-existence the art once more became one of great
importance, and a school of wood engraving grew up that
was not only very large, but the work done was of very high
quality.</p>

<p>Bewick’s style is not there, although it seems likely that
the revival was really due to his influence; the old black
line, resembling the engraved metal line, holds undisputed
sway. Moreover, the French nineteenth century revival
owes much directly to the work and influence of another
great English wood engraver, J. Thompson, and with him
worked an equally great French engraver, H. L. Brevière.
These two men were highly gifted, and their work is always
of a high order, and they met with much powerful support
from contemporary engravers, followers of their own, the
excellence of whose work in many instances ran their own
very close.</p>

<p>Among the many engravers of this time whose work is
always pleasant to meet with and admire we may particularly
note Thiébault, S. Soyer, Sears, <a id="Ref_114"></a>Porret, Roux, La
Coste and both his sons, Rouget, and Nivet.</p>

<p>The work of many of our contemporary English engravers
was also much liked in France, and they often helped to
illustrate fine French books. Among the more notable of
these engravers we find the names of Orrin Smith, Thomas,
Samuel, and Mary Ann Williams, and A. Best.</p>

<p>It must be noted that the work of the artists whose work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
was interpreted by this school of highly-skilled engravers
was admirably fitted for small book vignettes, especially the
military designs so profusely issued by <a id="Ref_115"></a>Meissonier, Horace
Vernet, and Raffet, and, for larger work, the charming
figures of Gavarni.</p>

<p>Augsburg in the fifteenth century was a great centre of
wood engraving. A Bible with small woodcuts was issued
there about 1470 by Jodoc Pflanzmann. These cuts were
meant to be coloured by hand. Several other books
illustrated with woodcuts were issued by Gunther Zainer
and Johan Bamler.</p>

<p>Then notable illustrated books were published at Ulm
and Lubeck, and from Nuremberg we have the great
“Nuremberg Chronicle,” full of woodcuts, the best of which
are cut by Wilhelm Pleydenwurff and Michael Wohlgemuth.
The work in this book gets away from the mere
outline, and we find much clever hatching and shading, but
there is much coarseness. From Basle came Seb. Brant’s
celebrated “Narrenschiff,” one of the most popular books
ever written, and illustrated with most amusing cuts of
the various follies of the various sorts of fools described.
Albrecht Dürer did a few illustrations for books towards
the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth
centuries.</p>

<p>Several more illustrated wood books were issued from
Nuremberg, Basle and Zurich, and some of the printers’
devices were designed by Holbein.</p>

<p>During the seventeenth century a lull occurred in the
production of German books illustrated with woodcuts;
but the art has always been popular in Germany, and it
never quite died out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>The very decorative “Triumph of the Emperor Maximilian,”
with large woodcuts, designed by Hans
Burgkmeier of Augsburg in the early sixteenth century,
was published in 1796. German wood engraving for
books revived in the nineteenth century, and became
of high excellence. German wood engravings have
had a certain strength and vigour all their own from
the time of the “Nuremberg Chronicle” until modern
times.</p>

<p>Artists, moreover, have not been wanting; the quite
delightful vignettes of A. Schrödter, L. Richter, G.
Osterwald, R. Jordan and others, have received adequate
and sympathetic treatment at the hands of engravers
who are second to none. Nuzelmann, E. Kretschmar,
A. Vogel, Beneworth, Joch, and the Leipzig firms of
Allanson and Sears, Nicholls and Bosse, and Peupin, some
of whom were foreigners.</p>

<p>Line engraving on a small scale plays an important
part in book illustration. It is the simplest, and yet
requires the most technical skill of all the methods of
marking metal surfaces for the purpose of making prints.
The engraver cuts out a thread of metal, producing a little
track on the surface, and to do this properly requires the
utmost skill.</p>

<p>It has been held for a long time that prints from
engraved metal plates owe their existence to the proofs in
sulphur which were taken from time to time from
engravings intended to be filled with niello.</p>

<p>In the museum at Berlin there is a print on paper from
an engraved metal plate, representing the Flagellation of
Christ. It is German work and dated 1446. The lettering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
shows rightly on the print, so the engraving was made
with the intent that prints should be made from it.</p>

<p>There is in the Bargello Museum at Florence a beautiful
Pax with a nielloed plate attributed to Maso Finiguerra,
the date of which is put at 1452. From this plate, before
it was nielloed, prints on paper were taken, and one of
them is at Paris. But the letterings on this engraving
read rightly on the metal, so it was not engraved with the
intent that prints should be made from it; indeed, they, as
well as the impressions in sulphur, were only made to
help in the working.</p>

<p>So that it is only safe to say that the possibility of
making prints on paper from engraved metal plates was
known about the middle of the fifteenth century both in
Germany and in Italy.</p>

<p>To make a print from an engraved plate requires great
pressure, as the paper has to be forced down into every
mark, and the resulting mark on the paper is consequently
always in relief.</p>

<p>The principle of a print made from an engraved wood
block is that the projecting parts are covered with a thin
film of ink, and when the paper is lightly pressed down
upon these lines it picks up the ink from the surface
wherever it touches it. In the case of an engraved metal
plate, the lines on which are cut in the same way and with
a similar graver to that used for white line engraving on
wood, the inking and printing is quite different. Now it is
the incised lines which print black, and in order to ensure
this the whole plate is well rubbed over with ink so as to
fill up all the incised lines, and then the unengraved
polished surface is carefully wiped clean so as to leave the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
ink sticking in all the dots, lines and curves. Now damped
paper is very strongly pressed upon the inked plate, so as
to be squeezed right down into every dot, line and curve.
The paper consequently is in relief wherever it has been
pressed into a depression, and as there was ink there
waiting for it, it will be found to have picked up and
absorbed all the ink, so that the print shows black lines in
low relief.</p>

<p>It will be easily realised that a print from an engraved
metal plate cannot be printed with ordinary type at the
same operation a wood-block can, so that whenever a book
occurs in which such engravings show on the same page
with type, there must have been two printings, one strong
for the engraving and one light for the type.</p>

<p>We find, therefore, that in several instances where
engraved illustrations have been used for a book which is
for the most part printed from type, that the small piece
of text which comes on the same page as the engraving,
is also engraved. Not only this, but from time to time
entire books have been engraved, illustrations as well
as text. The finest English example of such work is
to be found in the beautiful edition of the works of
Horace, plentifully illustrated and engraved throughout
on copper by John Pine. It was published in
1733-7.</p>

<p>John Sturt, who engraved numbers of book frontispieces,
also produced a Book of Common Prayer, engraved
throughout on silver, in 1717. He also engraved many of
John Ayres’ calligraphic works. Abroad, especially in
France and Germany, small books have been engraved, in
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, by P. Moreau,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
F. Mazot, Druet, and others, but none of them are as
important as the English. Music books are engraved, and
so are numbers of calligraphic books of small interest.</p>

<p>The first line engravings illustrating any book appear in
Bettini’s “Monte Santo di Deo,” printed in 1477. They
are said to be after designs by Botticelli. Some of
the prints are full page and others are printed on the
same paper as the text. They are not very good. The
same kind of illustration appears in Dante’s “Divina
Commedia,” printed in 1481. Some of these prints are,
however, pasted in, but a few are on the same paper as
the text.</p>

<p>The great excellence of Italian book illustrators on wood
seems to have eclipsed all other kinds. Italian line
engravers have excelled in large plates, but in books
there is little of this kind of work that is at all good.
Examples of small work of the kind were done in the
eighteenth century by Grandi, Schedl, Pomarade, I. Frey,
and C. Gregori.</p>

<p>In English books line engravings do not appear until
1521, when an edition of Galen published at Cambridge
possesses an engraved border.</p>

<p>Raynald’s “Byrthe of Mankind,” published in 1540, has
engraved plates. From this time engravings appear at
intervals until towards the end of the sixteenth century,
when frontispieces and portraits, always printed on separate
paper and inserted as extra leaves, became common.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century the same style prevailed, engraved
portraits and frontispieces, but gradually small pictures
came into use. The plates are often signed, and we find
the name of Renold Elstrack, who worked also in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
preceding century, Marshall, Hole, Cecil, Grover, and others
of less merit.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century native engravers seem to have
given way to foreigners, and the same thing happened
during the early nineteenth century. We find many
beautiful engravings in English books signed by Du Bosc,
Grignion, Scotin, De Launay, and others. Later, in the
nineteenth century, our English line engravers rallied,
and we owe much beautiful work to them. Many of their
names are widely known, and their work will be more
highly appreciated as time goes on, especially as this small
line engraving is practically a lost art.</p>

<p><cite>The Keepsake</cite>, published by Charles Heath, 1827-57,
started the fashion in England of small books illustrated
with delicate engravings on steel, but it must be noted
that although there is engraved work in them, the
greater part of the work is really etched. Exquisite
work in this style was done by W. Finden, D. Allen,
C. Rolls, T. C. Lewis, J. H. Robinson, E. Goodall,
H. and R. Wallis, W. R. and D. Smith, W. Humphreys,
John Pye, T. S. and F. C. Engleheart, F. and J. Goodyear,
and these engravers were supplied with beautiful
subjects by several of the eminent contemporary artists,
J. M. W. Turner, Stothard, Samuel Prout, and numbers
more.</p>

<p>Among the best examples of finely illustrated books
of this period the two volumes of Rogers’ <cite>Italy</cite> and
<cite>Poems</cite> may safely be noted. They were published in
London in 1830, and the very best results were aimed at in
their production. They are uniform, and usually bound in
red watered silk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Large numbers of small books illustrated profusely with
line engravings were published about the middle of the
nineteenth century. They often have engraved title-pages,
with little pictures in them, the full page illustration being
inserted throughout. The names of both artist and engraver
are usually added at the lower edge of the print.</p>

<p>There are <cite>Oriental Annuals</cite>, <cite>Landscape Annuals</cite>, <cite>New
Year’s Gifts</cite>, <cite>Friendship’s Offerings</cite>, <cite>Comic Offerings</cite>, <cite>Juvenile
Forget-me-nots</cite>, and a host of similar periodicals, and good
work is to be found in all of them. They were either
bound in thin panel stamped leather or else in watered silk,
and in either case the binding is of interest, and wherever
it exists it should be carefully preserved. A quaint little
woodcut often appears in these books, printed with the
text.</p>

<p>Besides the engravers whose names I have already mentioned,
there are many others whose work appears more
particularly in small periodical publications; among these
may be noted J. C. Armytage, Geo. Corbould, Charles
and J. Heath, James Mitan, John Sharpe, R. J. Baker,
W. Greatbach, J. C. Edwards, W. Fry, W. Chevalier,
S. Davenport, H. Robins, C. Warren, T. J. Williams, J.
Cousins, W. Miller, S. Sangster, R. Rhodes, F. Bacon, R. J.
and E. Portbury, T. Willmore, R. Brandard, J. H. Kernot,
W. D. Taylor, and G. Hollis.</p>

<p>After about 1850 small line engravings in books began to
disappear, and now they are rarely if ever done. In fact,
line engraving has been killed by mezzotint and photography,
and now takes refuge in its original goldsmiths’ use,
or in book plates.</p>

<p>Line engraving in France did not appeal to popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
taste until a comparatively late period. The block engravings
in the “Horae” of the fifteenth century, although they were
line engravings, were cut in the manner of wood blocks, and
the method of printing from them was different to that used
in the case of ordinary metal engravings. In the seventeenth
century there were several beautiful books illustrated
by line engravings by Sebastian Leclerc, L. Gaultier,
J. Sauné, F. Chauveau, Le Mire and H. J. Duclos.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century in France the graceful designs
of Ch. Eisen and J. H. Fragonard found many worthy interpreters.
La Fontaine’s fables and stories provided a suitable
literature for these illustrations, and among them may
perhaps be found the high water mark of small line
engraving. Indeed, the work is all so good that any choice
becomes almost invidious; but quite beautiful work was
done by J. B. Patas, Choffard, N. Le Mire, De Longueil,
L. Bosse, Delvaux, Johannot, Leroux, Lefebre, Ficquet,
Mottet, Prevost, J. B. Tillard, J. L. Delignon, C. L. Lingée,
Dupréel; and then come L. Halbon, J. Aliamet, J. Dambrun,
J. B. <a id="Ref_122"></a>Simonnet, P. Trière, C. S. Gaucher, and many more,
some of whom worked also in the next century.</p>

<p>In the nineteenth century the French level of small engraved
illustrations remained exceptionally high, especially
in the earlier half, but many of the plates have much etching
mixed up with line work; this may very likely mean that the
work was done on steel, which will admit of the production
of large editions; but steel is very difficult to engrave,
although it is quite easy to etch. Among the line engravers
who used accessory etching I have noted Pauquet, Aze,
P. Choffard, and De Villiers.</p>

<p>The engravers whose work may be safely considered of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
high quality are R. De Launay, Bertonnier, Villerey,
P. Savart, H. Dupont, Girardet, J. P. <a id="Ref_123"></a>Marillien, L. Petit,
J. F. Ribault, Chifflart, and V. Foulquier. Towards the
end of the century photography came and gradually crowded
out the small line engravers.</p>

<p>An etching is a drawing done with a needle point upon
a sheet of metal protected by a thin impervious coat of
soft varnish. The lines made by the etching needle pierce
the varnish or “ground,” and reach down to the metal,
usually copper, exposing it in those places. When the
drawing is complete the plate is put into a bath of strong
water, usually dilute nitric acid, and wherever the surface
is not protected by the ground the acid will eat away the
metal.</p>

<p>When now the ground is cleaned off with the help of
turpentine, the original design will be seen transferred to
the surface of the copper in the form of dull lines, shallow
if the acid has only been allowed to act for a short time,
but broad, deep and irregular if the “biting” has been
long. So that an etching always has a little more “effect”
than was put into the original work.</p>

<p>It is not necessary here to enter into the mysteries of
“stopping out,” and several other variations of procedure,
but it is sufficient to say that variations of tone and texture
<em>can</em> be obtained; but, in fact, so far as book illustrations go,
the etchings I know of are always simple, and the best of
them are those by George Cruickshank.</p>

<p>The printing of etchings is analogous to that of line
engravings, and a similar ink is used. A strong press is
required, the paper is damped, and the impression is in
slight relief. Line engravings are always printed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
same way as a visiting card, the untouched parts are clean,
and print white, but in the case of etchings more ink is
usually left, so that the untouched surfaces often show grey,
none of the ink having been allowed to remain upon the
plate. The French call this “retroussage,” and printers
can produce strange effects by its use. A bad etching can
be made to look like a good one; a good etching can be
made to look weak and wretched. In fact, a clever artist
printer can produce a capital picture from a plate which
has nothing at all on it but the ink.</p>

<p>Etchings first appeared in English books about the end
of the seventeenth century, but they are seldom signed,
neither are they good. There is an etched frontispiece to
Latroo’s “English Roque,” 1665, and another to “Æsop’s
Fables,” published in the same year.</p>

<p>Wenceslaus Hollar, a Bohemian who worked in London,
illustrated a few English books with etchings in the seventeenth
century. Soft ground etchings printed in red and
black appear in Pennant’s “Account of London,” printed
in 1795. In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
William Blake made a few etchings for book illustrations.
In the nineteenth century came Alken’s etchings of animals,
usually coloured, Samuel Hewitt, Doyle, and especially the
excellent work of George Cruickshank, which was very
much admired by John Ruskin.</p>

</div>

<p>Combined with line engraving a number of small illustrations
were published in the nineteenth century. They were
etched on steel, and carefully finished with small line work,
with ruled skies. They are generally classed as engravings,
but should, I think, rather be called etchings.</p>

<p>Etching has not played a very important part in French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
books any more than it has in English. There are the
amusing sketches of Callot, good work by Abraham Bosse
and Sebastian Leclerc, and in quite recent times the
beautiful etchings by Jules Jacquemart of works of art, in
their way unsurpassed, and marvels of technical skill. I
have already mentioned a few French etchers who combined
that work with small line engraving, probably on
steel; of these probably Choffard is best known and most
highly appreciated.</p>

<p>Engraving by dots has been for a long time practised, as
by its means a graduated tone can be more easily obtained
than it can by the use of line alone, and stipple is the same
idea carried out by the etching needle instead of the graver.</p>

<p>Stipple is done by means of small bunches of needles,
with which irregular dots are made in the etching ground
and then bitten by acid, as usual. In most cases a few
small finishing dots are put on the copper by hand afterwards.
Stipple is excellent for faces, and is best known in
the work of Bartolozzi, who excelled in it. It is said to
have been invented by Jacob Bylaert, a Dutchman, in
1760.</p>

<p>In England stipple engraving was largely used in the
early nineteenth century for book illustrations. It is found
chiefly in faces, and is generally supported by line engraving
or etching. The best stipple engravers did not illustrate
books, but the work of W. Finden, C. Knight,
J. Parker, C. Marr, and W. Holl is always good, though, of
course, very small. Besides these there were numbers of
lesser stipple engravers, whose work is fair&mdash;Jenkinson,
Dean, H. Cook, C. Wagstaffe, H. Robinson, and many more.</p>

<p>The same sort of usefulness was found for stipple abroad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
for faces particularly, and it was successfully practised by
Pfeiffer, Vangelisty, and others, but it never took the same
hold upon the Continent that it did here, either in the case
of small book illustrations or in the more important matter
of large stipple engravings.</p>

<p>Mezzotints are not satisfactory if they are on a small
scale. Delicate and minute work cannot be done well by
the mezzotint process alone, but require supplementary
line or etched work. So we find that mezzotints have not
been much used for book illustration.</p>

<p>The process of mezzotinting was invented by Ludwig von
Siegen, an officer in the Hessian Army, about 1642, and at
first it was practised chiefly by foreigners, but it soon
became the favourite method of engraving upon metal in
England; indeed, the competition of the mezzotint
eventually ruined the slower and more costly process of
line engraving.</p>

<p>Some books concerning mezzotints have explanatory
plates in them, beginning with Le Blon’s “Coloritto,”
written about 1721, but these can hardly be considered
as fair instances of ordinary book illustrations.</p>

<p>A copper plate is prepared for mezzotint engraving by
being uniformly roughened all over, so that if it were
inked and a print made from it, the print would show a
uniform velvety black. The art of the “scraper” consists
in so skilfully cutting away or burnishing down the
roughened surface of the copper that when a print is made
a picture appears. The scraper works from black to white
whenever the surface is scraped or burnished away, so in
exact correspondence the print will show grey or white. It
is quick work, and easy work up to a point, but to make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
first-rate mezzotint is a great art, and only a few engravers
have succeeded in doing it.</p>

<p>Among the first students of the art was Prince Rupert,
who was an excellent artist and an accomplished workman
all round. He engraved a large plate after Spagnoletto,
called “The Great Executioner,” and when John Evelyn
wrote a little book called “Sculptura,” which was published
in 1662, and included in it a short description of the new
art, the Prince mezzotinted a plate for him, showing only
the head of the great executioner. This head, the first
mezzotint done for a book, is a finer piece of work than the
head in the larger plate.</p>

<p>There were several anatomical plates, mostly printed in
coloured inks, which were mezzotinted about the same time,
but they are not important; then Faber’s portraits of
founders of the Colleges of Oxford and Cambridge were
used as illustrations to Rolt’s “Lives of the Reformers,”
published in 1759. These plates bear Houston’s name as
mezzotinter, but this is only one of a number of such
re-letterings which occur in the history of mezzotints.</p>

<p>Robert Dunkarton engraved several book illustrations,
mostly portraits, and he also helped in the mezzotinting of
some of the plates in Turner’s “Liber Studiorum.” He
was a portrait painter, and his mezzotints are better than
Faber’s. John Young was an eminent mezzotinter, and in
1815 he issued a large book of portraits of the Emperors of
Turkey printed in colours. They are not particularly good,
but are interesting as being the first set of mezzotints to be
issued in colour as book illustrations. The book is rare
and, if the colour is strong, of considerable value.</p>

<p>Turner’s “Liber Studiorum” was issued between 1807<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and 1819, and many mezzotinters helped in the work&mdash;F.
C. Lewis, Charles Turner, W. Say, R. Dunkarton, G.
Clint, J. C. Eastling, T. Hodgetts, W. Annis, H. Dawe,
T. Lipton, and S. W. Reynolds. The plates were not pure
mezzotint, but were strongly etched as well with some
aquatinting; the first etching was done by J. M. W.
Turner, and some of the mezzotinting. I think he probably
worked finally upon all the plates in various ways
with burin, scraper and roulette.</p>

<p>Several books of landscapes are illustrated with mezzotints,
done on copper or steel, by T. G. Lupton, many of
them after Turner, and John Constable’s landscapes have
been admirably mezzotinted by David Lucas; perhaps the
best known is “English Landscape Scenery,” published
in 1855.</p>

<p>In all mezzotints, large or small, it should be noted that
the <em>condition</em> of the print is important. The blacks should
be deep and velvety; if they show greyish or spotted, the
print is from an old plate. Mezzotints on steel last better
than if they are on copper. I know of no foreign books
illustrated with mezzotints.</p>

<p>There are several ways of making aquatints, but the
best is the oldest. It was invented by a Frenchman,
J. B. Le Prince, towards the end of the eighteenth century,
and although of foreign origin, the art has been most
extensively and successfully practised in England.</p>

<p>Le Prince allowed powdered resin to settle evenly on a
copper plate, fixed the minute grains by heat, and then treated
the plate with acid as if it were an etching. When the
plate was cleaned the acid is found to have bitten a little
line round each grain of resin, so that an aquatint made by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
this method consists of a series of small rings more or less
thick. The different thicknesses are produced by stopping
out some portions and re-biting others. The general effect
of aquatint is delicate and pleasing, and it can be
strengthened where necessary with a little etching.
Aquatint helps its followers considerably, and a good
aquatint made from a drawing or painting will often have
luminous effects that are wanting in the original.</p>

<p>There is one other method of aquatinting that must be
mentioned, but there are more which are too numerous and
too unimportant to require explanation here. It is a modern
invention, and consists of coating the plate with resin dissolved
in alcohol; when this dries it breaks up into little
pieces, and the acid can penetrate between these pieces as in
Le Prince’s method. But the resulting prints do not show
Le Prince’s little circles, but small irregular polygons.</p>

<p>Le Prince sold his secret to Charles Greville, and he
passed it on to Paul Sandby, who not only became an
eminent aquatinter but published a book in 1775 called
<cite>Twelve Views in Aquatinta</cite>. This drew much attention
to the beautiful new art, and it rapidly became very
popular in England. English aquatinters, like English
wood and stipple engravers, always liked colour, whether
added by hand or printed in ink, and so we find that the
large majority of English aquatinters enjoy the added
beauty of colour.</p>

<p>The publishers Ackermann and Boydell both deserve
much honour for their consistent patronage of aquatints,
and no doubt our splendid record in that art is largely due
to their enterprise.</p>

<p>Towards the latter part of the eighteenth century we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
already find several fine books with hand-coloured aquatint
illustrations published in England, among these are
W. Hodge’s <cite>Select Views in India</cite>, 1786; T. Hassell’s
<cite>Picturesque Guide to Bath</cite>, 1793; Combes’ <cite>History of
the River Thames</cite>, with aquatints by J. C. Stadler; E.
Orme’s <cite>Twelve Views of Places in the Kingdom of Mysore</cite>,
with aquatints by J. W. Edy; and H. Repton’s amusing
<cite>Sketches of Landscape Gardening</cite>, with moveable plates to
show how good his suggested improvements were, all published
in 1794, and from this time for the next thirty years
were numbers of books issued with coloured aquatints concerning
domestic architecture.</p>

<p>Early in the nineteenth century there are still numbers
of books with aquatint views in them: J. Webber’s <cite>Views
in the South Seas</cite>, published in 1808, and Boydell’s
<cite>Picturesque Scenery of Norway</cite>, with aquatints by J. W.
Edy, in 1820, and several more.</p>

<p>Then Rowlandson, the caricaturist, aquatinted the illustrations
for Goldsmith’s <cite>Vicar of Wakefield</cite> in 1817, and the
inimitable <cite>Tour of Dr. Syntax</cite>, by Combe, in 1820, thereby
setting the fashion for caricature in aquatint, which had a
considerable vogue.</p>

<p>In Pyne’s <cite>History of the Royal Residences</cite>, the out-door
views are printed in coloured inks, blue for the skies and
brown for the foregrounds. They have additional hand-colouring.
It is an important book, and was published in
1819; the aquatints are engraved by T. Sutherland, W. F.
Bennett, R. Reeve, and others.</p>

<p>Then came a series of fine books on Indian scenery,
mostly engraved by T. Medland, Hassell and Ellis,
and many books of English views, mostly engraved by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
D. Havell, T. Sutherland, T. H. Fielding, J. Baily, or
T. Cartwright.</p>

<p>Of less importance, but now becoming more esteemed,
are the numbers of graceful costume and fashion plates
which were done in aquatint and coloured by hand from
about 1790 to 1840. These books are already much sought
after, and will probably be more and more so in time; the
plates are generally anonymous.</p>

<p>William Daniell illustrated Ayrton’s <cite>Voyage Round Great
Britain</cite> with beautiful coloured aquatints; it was published
in 1825.</p>

<p>There are many cases in which several kinds of work
appear on the same plate; there may be aquatint and
etching, mezzotint with etching, engraving or aquatint, so
it is very important to be able to judge from the aspect of
a line or dot or a point by which method it has been
produced.</p>

<p>The magnificent account of the <cite>Coronation of George IV.</cite>,
published in 1825, under the care of Sir George Nayler,
Garter King of Arms, is illustrated with mixed engravings,
stipple, etching, line, aquatint and mezzotint, by S. W.
Reynolds and other engravers, chiefly after designs by
F. and J. Stephanoff. The plates are coloured by hand,
and several of the special copies have much extra artistic
work added. It is said to be the most expensive book ever
published, and it never repaid its cost, but received a grant
in aid from the Government of the day. The majority
of the figures are careful portraits, and it is the highest
authority for the State costume of the time.</p>

<p>Lithography is the art of drawing upon stone in such a
way that prints can be made from the drawing. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
drawing has to be done upon a particular sort of stone
either directly or by means of transfer from lithographic
paper, and it can be done either with a point of solid lithographic
ink resembling black chalk, or by a liquid ink, in
which case the drawing is called a lithotint. J. M.
Whistler was remarkably successful in this latter manner,
but it had been used long before by Hullmandel and
Cattermole.</p>

<p>The discovery of lithography was due to the experiments of
Aloys Senefelder, a native of Prague, who was born late in
the eighteenth century. He accidentally found that some
writing he had put on one of the stones he used for sharpening
his tools upon came off easily on to paper or linen.
Then he tried what effect acid would have, and found that
it would eat away the stone wherever the ink did not prevent
it, so he got a block in low relief. The protective ink
is made essentially of wax, tallow, soap, shellac, and lamp
black, and the acid renders this insoluble, so that when
acid is applied to the stone the parts drawn upon remain
unaffected. The drawing ink is now removed, and when
printing ink is applied by means of a roller, it sticks only
where the drawn lines are, and from this inked stone a
print can be obtained.</p>

<p>The surface of a lithograph is quite smooth, and the
process will not help an artist in the least&mdash;as the drawing
is so will the lithograph from it be; the only difference is in
the power of reproduction.</p>

<p>Senefelder was unfortunate; he introduced an art to the
world which has been very largely followed, but his own
efforts were failures from a business point of view. He
came to London early in the nineteenth century, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
methods soon found votaries, but he shortly returned to
Munich, where his brother had assisted him in setting up a
lithographic establishment, and this practically failing, it
was taken over by the Bavarian Government and put
under the management of H. J. Mitterer, a professor of
drawing.</p>

<p>But it was in France that lithography made most rapid
progress. The clever French draughtsmen that happened to
exist about that time very quickly mastered the process,
and between them they established a school of lithography
that is unequalled. Many of the greatest French artists
worked in it, and some of them specialised in it.</p>

<p>Lasteyrie introduced it, and it was quickly taken up by
Horace Vernet, Pierre Guerin, Charlet, and many others
for small book illustrations, and about 1830 there are large
numbers of caricatures done in this quick and easy way.
Then Gericault, Henri Monnier, Eugène Delacroix, and
J. B. Isabey swelled the list of French lithographers, most of
the book illustrations being of small size; and a little later
there is notable work done by Honoré Daumier, Achille
Deveria, Raffet, Jean Gigoux and Gavarni, several of them
specialising in military subjects. Towards the end of the
century we find a new set of artists, many of whom use
colour as well as monotint, Fantin-Latour, Chéret, O.
Redon, Gandara and Willett.</p>

<p>The social side of French life is perhaps the most
illustrated in lithography.</p>

<p>In England lithography received its first impetus from
Senefelder himself, who came and worked in London,
where in 1819 his <cite>Complete Course of Lithography</cite> was
published.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>C. J. Hullmandel and J. D. Harding were friends and
co-workers in the new art, and they were both adepts at it;
Hullmandel drew several of the beautiful plates of birds for
John Gould, and they were afterwards coloured by hand.
From the beginning colour has been much liked by English
lithographers, either added by hand or produced by means
of “chromo-lithography,” that is, several plates inked in
different colours and then printed over each other on one
piece of paper.</p>

<p>Roberts’ <cite>Holy Land</cite> is magnificently illustrated with
lithographic plates by Louis Haghe, a left-handed Belgian,
who worked here, and these plates were afterwards coloured
by hand. Clarkson Stanfield and Cattermole both worked
in lithography, and Nash’s <cite>Mansions of England in the Olden
Time</cite>, 1839-49, are familiar to most of us. Nash coloured
several copies by hand.</p>

<p>Owen Jones’ <cite>Plans of the Alhambra</cite>, published 1842-5,
are excellent chromo-lithographs. In quite modern times
the old tradition is worthily upheld by William Griggs,
whose colour plates of <cite>Illuminated MSS. in the British
Museum</cite> are in every way excellent&mdash;indeed, for truth and
fidelity to their originals they have never been equalled.</p>

<p>Munich was a sort of headquarters of lithography in the
early part of the nineteenth century, when H. J. Mitterer
succeeded to Senefelder’s establishment there. Among
the first lithographers in Germany were J. M. Mittenleiter,
who also invented the art of engraving on stone, and
Joseph Hauber.</p>

<p>Most of the German lithographers contented themselves
with making copies of existing pictures, and one of the
finest examples of this kind of lithography is to be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
in the <cite>Gemälde Galerie des K. Museums in Berlin</cite>, published
in 1842, and containing excellent work by Fr. Jentzen,
C. Fischer, and others.</p>

<p>Adolf Menzel did some notable lithographic work about
the middle of the century, and Mouilleron, Eybl, and Ritter
were all excellent workmen.</p>

<p>Belgian lithographers have nearly always been very good;
besides Haghe, who worked in England, there were, with
others, Tuerlinckoe, Van der Meulen, and Van Loo.</p>

<p>Although there have been lithographic workshops set up
at Rome, Florence, Turin, Milan, and other towns, the art
has never flourished much in Italy: it never appealed to
the sensitive artistic Italian nature. Such examples as do
exist are mostly portraits.</p>

<p>Lithography has been popular in Spain, and Spanish
artists have done excellent work in this manner.</p>

<p>In 1824 J. de Madrazo published the most important
Spanish work illustrated with photographs; it is called <cite>Collection
lithographica de cuadros del Rey ... Fernando VII.,
lithographiada por habiles artistas</cite>, among whom are named
J. Jollivet, P. Blanchard and A. Guerrero. The work of all
of these is excellent. Lithographic work in Spain, so far as
books are concerned, has been mostly of an archæological
character&mdash;views of old buildings or old pictures particularly.
F. Goya, however, worked largely in this manner.</p>

<p>All these methods of illustrating books worked by hand
have now been superseded by one or other of the wonderful
processes made possible by the invention of photography.
Some of these are expensive, but generally they are cheap.</p>

<p>The most elaborate, and when well done the most wonderful,
of these processes is that known as heliogravure. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
means of this method reproductions of line engravings can
be made so perfectly that detection is almost impossible. A
metal plate is so treated by help of a photographic negative
that the lines of the engraving are deposited in an insoluble
form upon the plate, which is otherwise clean, then a thin
film of metal is deposited on all the clean places by means
of electrotyping, so that when the lines are dissolved out,
they are in intaglio, just as they were in the original
engraved plate. From this artificial plate prints can be
made as if from an engraved plate.</p>

<p>For the mezzotint another method is adopted, known as
photogravure, and this is also a wonderful invention. A
metal plate is slightly roughed&mdash;if it could be more roughed
it would be better&mdash;and then a photographic relief in gelatine
is put upon it and etched. The result is a plate resembling
a fine grain mezzotint, but the prints made from it are
always deficient in the blacks. To remedy this and other
defects which at present seem to be inherent, an engraver
generally goes over the plate with roulette and burnisher.
The Photogravure has ruined the Mezzotint. The coating
of the copper-plates with steel largely adds to their life.</p>

<p>Then we come to the wood engravings, which are all
perfectly imitated by the zinc block, made directly from the
original drawing, and set on a wood block so as to range
exactly with type in height. Wash drawings are closely
copied by the half-tone process, which is also used with
blocks that can be printed with type. The drawing to be
copied is photographed through a glass screen very finely
etched with minute lines crossing each other, so that the picture
is ultimately represented by a series of little squares,
black or white according to the tones of the original. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
whites are never quite satisfactory, the dots of the screen
always show a little, so the dispossessed wood engraver has
to be called in after all to touch them up with a graver. In
America, where the half-tone process has reached a very
high degree of excellence, the names of these helpful
engravers are frequently added. A curious “shot-silk”
effect is often seen in half-tone illustrations where the lines
of the screen fall at a particular angle with the lines on the
original. The same peculiarity sometimes shows in the
ruled sky lines in the small nineteenth century line
engravings.</p>

<p>The three-colour process consists of half-tone blocks
printed in colours one over the other, but although they
look well they are not particularly true to their originals.
The reason of this is that each block is a little wrongly inked,
as the tint of the pigment put upon it depends entirely upon
the printer. He has of course a carefully coloured key given
him to match for each block, but he never quite succeeds in
doing more than get near it. There are line keys and colour
blocks, and half-tone and colour blocks, and many other
varieties of combinations of processes.</p>

<p>The half-tone process is certainly responsible for much
charming and valuable work, but it has done one very
great harm not only to itself but even to literature, it has
been the chief cause of the introduction of clay-laden paper
(see <a href="#Page_62">Chap. III.</a>).</p>

<p>The beauty of photographic illustrations can be best
seen in some of the recent French illustrated books in
colour published by the Société des Amis des Livres.
Other exquisite illustrations are to be found in Octave
Uzanne’s books, many of them from the drawings of Paul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Avril. The way in which many of these illustrations are
made to show over the printed page is often quite
charming.</p>

<p class="chapblock">Book edges and their decoration&mdash;Embroidered books&mdash;Cloth bindings&mdash;Account
books&mdash;End papers&mdash;Small metal-bound books&mdash;Books
bound in tortoiseshell&mdash;Chained books&mdash;Horn books.</p>

<p>The projecting bosses and corners which occur in
mediæval bindings were to protect them against the friction
of other books which lay upon them, a thin piece of wood
dividing them. The books were piled upon each other,
so that if one of the lower ones was wanted it was necessary
to remove the upper ones. This caused much trouble, so
that in due time it was found better to stand the books up
on end on shelves.</p>

<p>The prone position is, however, the better one for the
book, and the respective levels of the edges of the book and
the edges of the boards are designed for this position.
When the books were set up on end, the discrepancy
between the levels of the book edges and the board edges
was never rectified, and the result is that a large amount of
damage has been done. When a large book is set up on
end, the weight of it rests entirely upon the lower edges of
the boards, and the lower edges of the book itself are up in
the air above the shelf by so much as the projection of the
edges of the boards beyond them. The result is that the
whole of the weight of the vellum or paper of the book
pulls upon the bands of the back in their weakest direction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
from within and more particularly from the top, thereby
pulling the back inwards. The mass of the book falls
forward slantingly, until the lower edge of the front of it
rests upon the shelf.</p>

<p>It is difficult to describe, but my sketch will show what I
mean, and the truth of it can be easily seen in almost any
library of old books that are kept “on end”; the edges will
be found grubby from resting on the shelf, and the top
of the back will be found pulled
forward.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 70.</span>&mdash;Inside of

reason of being
kept upright.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Valuable books that are kept upright
should have the edges of the boards level
with the edges of the leaves, and then
this disastrous pull would not occur.</p>

<p>A remedy, however, may be found by
means of a piece of wood cut the same
size as the lower edge of the book so as
to fit closely into the hollow between the
outer edges of the boards and the lower
edges of the leaves. Such a slip will
neutralise the drop of the leaves, and preserve the proper
form of the backs of heavy books.</p>

<p>But before the upright position was finally adopted for
books, and their titles were put on their backs, the front
edge or “forage” of the leaves was always kept outwards,
in view, and on this space or long panel all sorts of devices
and letterings were put.</p>

<p>Leaves of a book, pressed tightly together, provided too
tempting a space to be ignored, to say nothing of the
usefulness of giving the name or title of the book, or the
device of its owner, or even a decorative design. So on fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
mediæval books and also on later books, following the earlier
manner in their own way, we find all sorts of designs on
book edges. It is not a subject which has attracted much
attention as yet, but it probably will in time, and there is
already enough known about it to show that much valuable
knowledge is lying hidden up in it. For instance, if a
book, otherwise likely, has the words “Rex in Æternum
Vive” painted in gold on the edges, it is a positive sign
that it issued from the workshop of Thomas Berthelet,
printer and binder to Henry VIII.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 71.</span>&mdash;Forage decoration in colour. Tenth century.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Edge decoration of some sort seems to have been done
from the tenth century onwards; at first elementary or
symbolical designs were simply painted upon the edges, and
not counting the mere book titles or press marks, it may be
said that since the fourteenth century heraldry has played
a very important part in edge decoration. In England this
form of adornment for a bound book has been largely
followed from that time, and there are fine examples of it
in books bound for Henry VII. and the other of our Tudor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
sovereigns, as well as for private persons of the same period.
The edges are treated as panels and the painting done
upon them when pressed firmly and solidly together. The
edges are generally coloured some neutral colour as a
groundwork and sometimes lettering in gold is done upon
them.</p>

</div>

<p>Henry VIII. often had the legend “<span class="smcap">Rex in Æternum
Vive Nez</span>” written in gold on the cream coloured edges
of his books, and all that are so lettered are attributed to
Thomas Berthelet as binder. The “Nez” is rather a
puzzle, and it was suggested by Mr. J. L. Scott, of the
British Museum, that it stands for the three initial letters
of the phrase in the Book of Daniel, <a id="Ref_144"></a>Ναβουχοδονὀσωρ Εσαει
ζῆθι&mdash;a quite possible solution.</p>

</div>

<p>Queen Anne Boleyn’s copy of the New Testament has her
name, “<span class="smcap">Anna Regina Angliæ</span>,” written in red upon its
gilt edges.</p>

<p>For Queen Elizabeth, book edges were usually gilded, and
on this gilding designs were impressed with ordinary
binding tools. This is the commonest form of edge
decoration, and is called “gauffring.” Gauffred edges
are found in abundance in French, German and Italian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
work. There are fine examples
of it on books bound for Henri
II. of France and all his children,
and on those made for
Diane de Poictiers, Duchesse
de Valentinois. In all these
cases colour is often added to
the designs on the gold. Le
Gascon put some elaborately
painted edges on some of his
hooks; on Italian books and
English books colour is sparingly
used; on the other hand,
in Germany and the Low
Countries colour was often
overdone and the result is
garish.</p>

<p>Until the time of Samuel
Mearne, towards the end of the
seventeenth century, all edge
paintings were done on the
edges of the leaves simply
pressed solidly together, but
Mearne invented a new fashion
of arranging the leaves. In
the case of the older manner
we usually find the upper and
lower edges painted as well as
the fore-edge, or “forage,” but
it is only the forage that can
be painted in Mearne’s style,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
and so in all instances of this kind the upper and lower
edges are left plain.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 74.</span>&mdash;Book fanned out to show forage painting in Mearne’s style.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Mearne had his book forwarded, finished, and the edges
gilded before beginning his painting. Then he opened the
book by the upper board only, and laid it down flat on its
back and kept it in that position by weights. In this
position it will be found that the forage fans out into a
larger panel than exists when the book is shut up. On
this fanned-out panel the painting was done in water-colours
with as dry a brush as possible. When the
painting was finished and the book allowed to resume its
normal shut position, the edge painting entirely disappeared,
and the gilding on the forage looked as if nothing was
behind it. So thoroughly does such a painting disappear
that I have found several that were quite unknown to their
owners, and I have no doubt that there are plenty of
unrecognised examples in English private libraries in
perfect condition and safe obscurity.</p>

Charles II. in colour,

book bound for the
king by Samuel
Mearne.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The only name I have found on any of Mearne’s forage
paintings is that of “Fletcher.”</p>

<p>After Mearne, for about one hundred years, I know of no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
particular development of forage
decoration, but towards the end of the
eighteenth century, the same principle
was revived by James Edwards of
Halifax. Edwards had an artist
brother, and it is likely enough that
he painted the edges on his brother’s
curious vellum-bound books. The
designs are not so markedly heraldic
as the earlier examples were, but are
often biblical.</p>

<p>Edwards’ delicate paintings, always
on small books, were copied for some
considerable period, and many little
books were made with such work upon
them for many years. Windsor and
Eton are both favourite subjects, and
country houses of all sorts. Landscapes
are particularly suitable for
this form of painting, and many specimens
are very pleasing.</p>

<p>All the foregoing paintings are done
so as to be complete on each book, but
some time ago a remarkable set of
Italian books, I believe of the sixteenth
century, were brought to England.
The forages of these volumes
were painted in such a manner that
the complete design only showed when they were all
arranged in proper order on a shelf with their forages outwards.
In the case of sets of books bound uniformly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
this manner of ornamenting them is worthy of the attention
of some of our enterprising modern binders.</p>

<p>Although the greater number of books, both in manuscript
and printed, have been bound in leather or vellum, there
are still very many that have been covered in other
materials.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_148.jpg" width="600" height="646" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 76.</span>&mdash;English velvet binding, with seals, made for
Henry VII.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The commonest of these materials are velvet, canvas,
satin, silk, cloth, linen, and buckram. I believe that all of
these, except perhaps the last three in recent times, have
been more used in England than they have been in any
other country.</p>

<p>Velvet is the most interesting, as its use is the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
ancient, of any of these textile materials. It is strong
and beautiful, the fur or pile being produced in a very
curious manner. Two warps are used in the manufacture
of the fabric, and small hollow brass wires, slightly flattened
at the sides, and having a groove along the top, are inserted
transversely under the raised “pile” warp at intervals as
the weaving proceeds. These wires keep the thread in the
form of upright loops, resembling those which can be seen
on a Brussels carpet on a larger scale. The wires are then
cut out by drawing a sharp specially-designed knife called
a truvat along the groove at the top. The consequent
separation of the warp threads which formed the rows of
loops now forms the pile, each thread standing upright.
It is wonderful how well velvet lasts, and what hard wear
it will stand before all the pile is worn away.</p>

<p>Books bound in velvet are not uncommon in Dutch work;
they are sometimes inlaid in differently coloured velvets,
and sometimes embroidered. In France books have rarely
been bound in velvet, in Italy and in Germany still more
rarely.</p>

<p>In England, however, there has been a considerable output
of velvet bindings. Examples still exist that were made
in the fifteenth century for Henry VII., whose library was
in all probability entirely bound in this material. Nothing
earlier than Henry VII.’s books are now known of English
bindings in velvet, but these are so fine that it is likely
enough that earlier work of the kind was done in the case
of very choice manuscripts.</p>

<p>Not only are Henry VII.’s books, which are still in their
original covers, in marvellously good condition, but they
are also among the most decorative bindings that have ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
been made, here or in any other country. Fine examples
may be seen in the library at Westminster Abbey, at the
Record Office, and in the British Museum, and in every case
their beauty and interest well repay the trouble of obtaining
access to them.</p>

<p>These volumes
all are in the same
style, but they vary
in detail. All I have
seen are in red
velvet, and have
metal bosses in the
centre and smaller
ones in the corner.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 77.</span>&mdash;English embroidered book, velvet.
Made for Henry VIII.</p></div>
</div>

<p>One of the handsomest,
which may
be taken as a type,
is a copy of the
indentures made
between Abbot Islip
and Henry VII. for
the foundation of
the chantry at Westminster.
It is a
large manuscript on vellum, and is covered in rich red
velvet projecting liberally over the edges, and bound
with gold fringe. In the centre is a circular silver cup-like
boss, containing the royal coat of arms, France and England
quarterly, with supporters of red dragon of Cadwallader
and white greyhound of De Beaufort, cut out of silver and
enamelled in proper colours. At each corner is a circular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
silver boss containing the De Beaufort device of a portcullis
gilt and cut in low relief, and set on an enamelled background
of the Tudor livery colours, green and white, per
pale. There are clasps of cloth of gold braid, fastening with
a chased silver-gilt button bearing an enamelled rose, and
dependent from the lower edge of the board are five silver
boxes bearing Tudor emblems in relief, each containing an
impression of the great seal.</p>

<p>It is also recorded by Paul Hentzner that in 1598 he saw
Queen Elizabeth’s library, and that many of them were
bound in velvet and embroidered, a note that is fully corroborated
by such of her books as now remain.</p>

<p>But there were also books embroidered upon canvas in the
fifteenth century, one of which is now in the British Museum.
It is a psalter of the fourteenth century, and is covered in
fine canvas on which are delicate embroideries in the manner
known as “Opus Anglicanum,” which looks like a chain
stitch, but is really a cleverly managed split stitch.</p>

<p>This remarkable book, the earliest known example of an
embroidered binding, has upon one side a beautiful representation
of the Annunciation, and on the other a Crucifixion.
It is supposed to have been worked by Anne de
Felbrigge, a nun in the convent of Minoresses, at Brusyard,
in Suffolk, and daughter of Sir Simon de Felbrigge, K.G.,
standard bearer to Richard II. It is considerably worn and
faded, but the designs can all be made out.</p>

<p>The velvet books which were made in the next reign
were ornamented with embroidered designs appliqués, and
many of them are very handsome. The designs on such
books were nearly always heraldic, judging from those
that remain, but arabesques and floral ornamentation are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
often met with on satin. Queen Katharine Parr is said to
have embroidered some of these books, and there is one in
canvas in the British Museum, and one in canvas and one
in velvet at the Bodleian, which are supposed to have been
worked by the Princess Elizabeth, always with braid.</p>

<p>When Elizabeth came to the throne she continued her
evident liking for velvet bound
books, and she had them of
several colours&mdash;red, green, or
black. Several of these are
richly embroidered, sometimes
with armorial designs, sometimes
floral, and sometimes
arabesque. Others are decorated
with brilliant enamels or
gold, centrepieces, cornerpieces,
and clasps, and others again
have appliqué pieces of coloured
satin, on which is gold tooling,
some of which is actually put
on the velvet itself.</p>

<p>Canvas is rarely found
during Elizabeth’s reign, but
it does exist, and is usually embroidered in a coarse manner
with tent-stitch.</p>

</div>

<p>In the seventeenth century the taste for velvet bindings
still remained, but not so exclusively, as there were many
more bound in silk or satin, usually white. The majority
of these books are small, Prayers, Bibles, Psalms, and the
designs upon them are of great variety, but generally have
a symbolic tendency&mdash;figures of Faith, Hope, Charity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Peace, Plenty, and numbers of biblical subjects, David and
Bathsheba, Solomon and Queen of Sheba, Jacob’s Dream,
Jacob wrestling with the Angel, Abraham and Isaac, and
many more; and besides these there are numbers of quaint
little bindings with floral designs.</p>

</div>

<p>The period of Nicholas Ferrar’s curious establishment
at Little Gidding
in Huntingdonshire
was coincident
with the reign of
Charles I. Here
were contrived most
interesting Harmonies
of the Scriptures,
done under
Ferrar’s superintendence
by his nieces
Mary Collet and her
sisters. These ladies,
moreover, bound the
Harmonies themselves,
and were not
only the first English
lady binders but also the first amateur binders, and they
bound exceedingly well. Mrs. Wordsworth was another
pioneer among lady binders. She covered her books in
pieces of her own old dresses.</p>

<p>Not only did the ladies of Little Gidding bind their
Harmonies, sometimes very large, in sheep skin, morocco
and calf, but also in velvet, curiously ornamented. I have
already mentioned that in the sixteenth century the art of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
gilding upon velvet was known, but it was reserved for the
ladies of Little Gidding to bring it to perfection.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 80.</span>&mdash;English, embroidered binding
canvas, seventeenth century.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There will always be some little doubt as to whether
these magnificent gold and silver tooled velvet books were
done entirely by the binders at Little Gidding, or with the
assistance of their
masters, Bucks of Cambridge.
There is a
marked similarity of
general style as well as
of detail, but the larger
Little Gidding books
appear particularly to
bear the impress of
more irresponsible
genius than that of the
orthodox university
printers.</p>

<p>Gilding upon velvet
is still practised a little
in England; the service
books used at the
wedding of the present
Prince of Wales were in
red velvet with the royal monogram impressed in gold upon it.</p>

<p>With the eighteenth century an end came to any great
output of bindings in velvet, canvas or satin; now and then
an isolated specimen is found, and the era of cloth bindings
began in the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The main difference is that the earlier books in velvet,
canvas or satin were always specially broad, but the cloth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
bindings were trade bindings from the beginning, with
very few exceptions.</p>

<p>At first backs of paper bound books were strengthened
by pieces of ordinary linen or calico pasted over them, the
title being added on a label; but a special cloth for binding
purposes was made early in the century by James Leonard
Wilson, and in 1822 Pickering’s Aldine Classics bound in
that material were issued. This use of a special cloth was
largely helped and fostered by Mr. Archibald Leighton, who
made a speciality of it. The cloth was sometimes watered
and sometimes plain. Cloth soon became a favourite
binding for cheap books, and in time Wilson found a way
of gilding upon it, probably by the use of dried and
powdered albumen.</p>

<p>Some of the early cloth bindings were ornamented by
impressions from engraved cylinders, the pattern showing
in low relief. The great pressure which was used to make
this impression had so hardened the cloth as well as the
boards upon which it is fixed, that many of the existing
examples of the work are still in perfect condition.</p>

<p>Then gradually came ornamentation stamped in gold on
the sides and gold lettering on the back, and of recent years
designs and pictures stamped in colours upon cloth, canvas
and buckram have become common. Many of these
designs are excellent, and the work required for them gives
employment to a large number of designers as well as
colour printers and block makers. Books bound in these
materials look well and last well for a time, but they are
essentially short-lived if handled much.</p>

<p>About the middle of the nineteenth century numbers of
small illustrated periodicals, landscape annuals, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
like were covered in watered silk, generally red, blue or
green. These also do not last well; but if any copies that
are still in a good state are found, they should be carefully
preserved as they are, and not be rebound; they represent a
type of binding that is by no means without charm.
Perhaps the most important books which were originally
issued in this form of cover were the two beautiful volumes
of Rogers’ <cite>Poems</cite> and <cite>Italy</cite>. They have gilt edges and are
bound with flat open backs and sawn in bands.</p>

<p>Buckram is generally used for large books, as it is stiff
and troublesome to fold over in a small way. If a large
book is properly sewn and has proper boards it may well
be covered in buckram, provided it is not to be much
used. The joints soon look unsightly, as the hinge
movement causes the dressing, of which there is a large
proportion, to powder out. Buckram is rarely ornamented;
indeed, it may almost be said that a book bound in it is only
intended to keep together until such time as it can be
properly bound in some better material.</p>

<p>Art canvas is sometimes used for bindings, and it is fairly
satisfactory, but has the same delicacy at the joints as
buckram, and soon looks shabby.</p>

<p>There is now such a quantity of cheap literature that is
not likely to last, or to be wanted to last, that there is a
large and increasing demand for cheap binding materials
other than leather. So there is an important future for
specially prepared binding cloths and buckrams. The only
libraries that are likely to suffer by the more general introduction
of such materials are the few large ones that are
obliged to keep all their books, old or new, in working order
inside and outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Account book bindings are peculiar and very strong.
They have been used for a long time in banks and business
houses, and are purely utilitarian and comparatively quite
modern.</p>

<p>Strong sound paper is an essential for account books.
The sewing is done in the flexible style, but on broad flat
bands of vellum or leather instead of raised bands of hemp.
The ends of the bands are fixed between two boards, pairs
of which form the boards of the book. The space between
the edge of the back of the book where the bands leave it
and their inset to the boards is not drawn close, but a
narrow margin is left so that a perfectly flexible and strong
leather joint is left. In small books this peculiarity is
known as a French joint, and it obviates the common
failing of sides falling away from otherwise sound bindings
along the joint-line at the back.</p>

<p>The back of account book bindings looks very strong, but
it is really nothing of the sort. It is only a show back, to
take the lettering and cover up the real joints, which are
securely laid along the edges of the boards.</p>

<p>When an account book is opened it “sets up” so that
it can be easily read right down to the sewing at the back.
This is of great value in many cases other than the keeping
of accounts, and it is the only advantage of the common,
but weak, bindings with “hollow” backs. But there is no
doubt that a modified form of account book binding, with a
French joint, is a style which might with advantage be
studied by our modern art binders.</p>

<p>The study of end papers is to some extent necessary for
the true judgment of the work of certain binders. For
instance, Thomas Berthelet normally used white end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
papers, Samuel Mearne used red marbled end papers, and
Roger Payne used purple or pink end papers. The Italian
binder who worked for Grolier used vellum for end
paper, and so on. The knowledge of such details is useful
in detecting frauds, as they are apt to be under-estimated
in importance by a forger.</p>

<p>Of all end papers the most common is marbled paper,
and one of the most curious usages of it is when a beautiful
and delicate French binding has a charmingly gold tooled
doublure of splendid leather faced by a wretched leaf of
marbled paper.</p>

<p>The usual marbled paper is made by means of a bed of
size on which colour is sprinkled by a brush, the colour
lies on the top of the size and is moved about by means of
a wide-toothed comb or a pin or anything that is handy,
until the resulting pattern is to the satisfaction of the
operator. Then the paper is laid down in the size, and
when raised up it brings all the colour with it. It is
generally easy to see how the pattern has been made by
looking at the paper, and it will be found that the most
usual forms have been made by the use of a broad-toothed
comb. I should think that the process might well have
produced something better than it ever has; undoubtedly
if J. M. Whistler had ever known of it we should have had
some remarkable results.</p>

<p>Marbling is probably of Oriental origin, and was most
likely first practised in Germany, so far as Europe is concerned.
It was certainly understood in Nuremberg in
1599, as specimens made there are to be seen in the
<cite>Album Amicorum</cite>, of J. Cellarius, of that date. It is,
of course, obviously capable of endless modifications, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
of late years some very delicately and prettily coloured end
papers have been made.</p>

<p>More or less in continuation of the mediæval fashion
of covering book-bindings with richly-worked metal
overlays, we find, in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries particularly, numbers of small books bound in
metal or with metal enrichments in the form of centrepieces
and cornerpieces. Clasps occur all along, and although I
hardly think that they have followed out any very marked
line of development, I expect
that some day a careful study
will be made of them, when
some such development may
possibly be discovered. No
student, as far as I am aware,
has made any attempt to
classify book clasps.</p>

made for Henry VIII.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But the English, German,
French, Italian, and Dutch
bindings with metal enrichments
are pretty well known
and generally admired. The English are the finest by
far, and, as far as I can ascertain, the earliest. In the
reign of Henry VIII. it was the fashion for ladies to
carry small books of devotion at their girdle. These
little books were always ornamental, and they had a ring
fixed on the lower edge of the binding so that when the
book was lifted up it came right for reading. One of
these belonged to one of the queens of Henry VIII.; it
is a copy of the Psalms, and is bound in gold with a
delicate leafy spray in high relief. On it are remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of enamel, and in the beginning is a tiny miniature of
the king.</p>

<p>Another beautiful little golden book with a design, probably
by Holbein, in black enamel, is now the property of
Lord Romney.</p>

<p>Several small golden bindings with scriptural subjects in
high relief and enamelled were made late in the sixteenth
century. Most of these are now divorced from their
original texts, and are only kept as specimens of enamel
work, but in one instance the whole book is perfect. This
is a little book of prayers that belonged to Queen Elizabeth.
On one side of it is the Serpent in the Wilderness and on
the other the Judgment of Solomon.</p>

<p>For the same queen a little copy of <cite>Christian Meditations</cite>
was bound in red velvet with golden centrepieces,
corners, and clasps. The enamels in this case are champlevé,
and still perfect in colour. They are said to have
been the work of George Heriot, Elizabeth’s goldsmith, who
founded a hospital in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>James VI. of Scotland wrote the <a id="Ref_180"></a>βασιλικον Δωρον
for his son Henry, and the precious MS. was bound in
purple velvet with golden centrepiece and clasps. The
gold is cut out thin and then finished by engraving. When
king of England James had some of his books bound in
velvet with silver enrichments. On one of these, a little
book of <cite>Christian Meditations</cite>, which is bound in purple
velvet, the royal coat-of-arms is engraved on the centre
oval, and on the corners are the national crests of England
and Scotland, the crowned harp of Ireland, and the
fleur-de-lis of France.</p>

<p>A beautiful little New Testament of 1643 with silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
portraits of Charles I. and Queen Henrietta Maria, and
cornerpieces and clasps engraved with allegorical figures,
shows that metal on velvet was still a popular style, but
on later bindings in England metal centrepieces fell quite
out of use. Metal corners, however, were still used for some
time, and clasps occasionally.</p>

<p>Bindings entirely of silver are rare in English workmanship,
but they were not unknown, as a fine specimen with
a repoussé figure of Charity covers a
Common Prayer of 1632.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 82.</span>&mdash;German
binding in silver
filigree and niello.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Of German and Dutch workmanship
many metal bindings exist, and
they are of varied styles. All these
bindings have solid metal backs with
hinges along the sides, and usually a
sort of cap projecting over the headband.
Many of the later examples are
not good, but are made of bad metal
and coarsely worked in repoussé. The
worst of them are probably Dutch work.</p>

<p>Some of the earlier German silver bindings are prettily
ornamented with niello work, and others have filigree work
over gilt metal, and the use of tortoiseshell with silver or
gilt mounts is also found of Spanish, German, or Dutch
workmanship. I should say that the best guide to determine
to which of these countries the work belongs is to
take the place of imprint as authoritative. The imprint
on a printed book does not by any means always imply
that a binding was made there, but in many doubtful cases
it is undoubtedly of much value as to mere nationality;
the style of the binding itself should always be the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
consideration. Some Dutch bindings are made in base
metal, gilt, often with open work and engraving. They
are neither good to look upon nor pleasant to handle.</p>

<p>Italian bindings in metal are rare, and it is only in the
case of very small books that it was ever used. The
manner of this is usually fine filigree work over a gilt
groundwork. There is one example in the Victoria and
Albert Museum, which is, however, more likely to be quite
an exceptional production than one in
any way representing a national type.
It is an exquisitely enamelled golden
book cover, having on one side the
Garden of Eden and on the other the
Fountain of Youth; it contains a
missal, and is said to have been made
for Queen Henrietta Maria.</p>

<p>In France a few silver bindings of
the sixteenth century with enamels
have been made, but they are very
rare, and the enamels of the basse
taille style, usually badly chipped.</p>

<p>I believe some small metal bindings
with rough enamels upon them have been made in comparatively
modern times in Russia. These all have a strong
Byzantine feeling and are clear survivals of the same style
that was in vogue in Russia in mediæval times, and was
used not only for bindings but also for ikons and triptychs.
The work is coarse and unsatisfactory.</p>

</div>

<p>Tortoiseshell mounted in metal has been largely used for
bindings in Holland, Germany, and Spain. The backs are
hinged to the sides with long snuff-box hinges, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
shell itself is sometimes beautifully inlaid with silver and
mother-of-pearl. Some of these covers are very small,
particularly the Dutch ones, and designs are sometimes
impressed upon them.</p>

<p>Mother-of-pearl has now and then been utilised for
binding very small books. The backs and hinges are
usually of silver.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 84.</span>&mdash;German chained
book, fifteenth century.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The curious custom of fastening books to their shelves
by means of chains was common enough in Europe in
mediæval times and became almost
universal in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries in churches. It
was of course done as a safeguard
against thieves, and as far as I
know only in the case of printed
books. Although printed books
soon became plentiful, yet no doubt
in the case of Bibles and Prayer
Books it is likely enough that a
considerable leakage took place.
Such small books were commonly
chained to the backs of the pews
in private chapels throughout England, and undoubtedly
the custom, though inconvenient in use, was effective
enough for its purpose.</p>

<p>Larger books would naturally belong to important
libraries, those of cathedrals and churches particularly,
and of these there are still left plenty of examples still in
chains.</p>

<p>The chains are of iron, average 3 feet long, and are
clamped to the front edge of the upper board by means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
a rivet; the other end of the chain is provided with a ring
which runs freely to and fro along a locked metal rod.
Enough play is given by the chain to allow of the book
being taken off its shelf and rested on the desk close at
hand which is always provided for it.</p>

<p>There is a certain fashion in the way of attaching these
chains. In foreign books the fastening is usually found at
the top of the upper board, while in the case of English books
it is usually fixed on the front edge of the upper board.
The books were normally kept with their forages outwards,
and on these edges the titles were written or emblazoned.</p>

<p>The Laurentian Library at Florence has a large number
of chained books kept in beautifully carved shelves.</p>

<p>The Church of St. Wallberg in Zutphen has several
chained books. There is a legend that the devil carried off
so many of the holy books that something had to be done,
so the chains were blessed in due form with holy water,
since when the books have been safely preserved.</p>

<p>Plenty of examples of chained libraries are still left in
England, particularly at Hereford Cathedral, the old
treasure house at Wimborne Minster and All Saints’ Church
at Hereford; a complete list of them is given in Blades’
“Books in Chains,” published in London in 1892.</p>

<p>The inconvenience of chains must have been considerable,
and no doubt careless readers often got into trouble about
them. On a notice concerning the library at King’s College,
Cambridge, in 1683, readers are requested to replace the
volumes “decently without entangling the chains.”</p>

<p>About the middle of the eighteenth century the inconvenience
of chains on books was fully realised, and from
that time there has been a general tendency to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
removal, except in cases where their retention is advisable
for antiquarian reasons.</p>

<p>True horn books were used in England and America,
but similar constructions also existed in other countries&mdash;chiefly
France, Germany, Italy,
and Holland&mdash;but without horn
covering.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 275px;">
<img src="images/i_165.jpg" width="275" height="508" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 85.</span>&mdash;English seventeenth
century horn book.</p></div>
</div>

<p>They were for children’s use,
and the alphabet and the Lord’s
Prayer are the commonest letterings
upon them, always beginning
with a cross, giving the first
line the name of the “Christ
cross” or “criss cross” row.
The paper for true horn books is
printed only on one side, and
then laid down upon a flat piece
of wood. Some unused eighteenth
century horn book sheets
are preserved in the Bagford
fragments at the British Museum.
Over the printed slip a piece of
horn is put, kept in place by strips of brass fastened with
nails having facetted tops, but it must be noted that after
about 1820 the facetted tops were often replaced by
flat heads.</p>

<p>Like all books or objects which were originally cheap and
common, horn books are now very rare, but they are so
valuable that it is unluckily worth while to imitate them,
and many fraudulent modern specimens are about. A horn
book is, unfortunately, easy to copy, and it is sometimes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
very difficult thing to say positively whether a given
specimen is genuinely old or not. Modern frauds are often
wrong in either the printing, the paper, the horn, or the
nails, but they are often right as to the wood, which is
easily made to have every proper appearance of age by
means of soaking in water, rubbing with sand, staining by
ammonia, and so on. Collectors should, if possible, get a
properly authenticated history with every specimen offered
to them.</p>

<p>Small plaques for teaching the alphabet seem to have
existed before the invention of printing, but in printed form
they were most used towards the end of the sixteenth
century until the nineteenth, when their character altered,
the wooden frame and its horn covering disappeared, and
a degenerate production in varnished cardboard, preserving
the old form in some respects, took their place. These
cards are often called battledores, but this name was an
old one, and originally used for true horn books. The
name battledore is probably derived from the batlet, which
was used for beating clothes, the horn books somewhat
resembling this in shape.</p>

<p>Although the general run of horn books are simple, there
are many instances in which they have been decorated; a
certain analogy thus exists between the diptychs and the
horn books. Lord Egerton of Tatton has a beautiful sixteenth
century example, the back of which is ornamented
with silver filigree work, and horn books backed with Dutch
silver, engraved, are sometimes found. These generally
have a bird or a tulip engraved upon them.</p>

<p>Other ornamental examples are to be found in the
Birmingham Museum and in private ownership. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
are very decorative, and some of them have talc instead of
horn in front.</p>

<p>In 1851 some curious stone moulds were found at Hartley
Castle by Sir George Musgrave, and one of them was
undoubtedly used for casting lead “horn” books, and
similar moulds have been found in Germany; the English
ones may have been made about the earlier half of the
sixteenth century.</p>

<p>But more curious devices were found on the other side of
the same piece of stone: these are undoubtedly the emblems
of saints’ days as shown on clog almanacks of the same
period, so that the horn books may possibly have originated
from the makers of cast leaden almanacks.</p>

<p>Horn books were also cut in ivory or bone, often with
designs engraved on the back or on the handle. The lettering
and devices were originally run in with heelball or some
such material. They were also made of boxwood with letters
burnt in, or engraved pewter, or gingerbread, and sometimes
covered in paper with panel stamp impressions in
blind or black ink.</p>

<p>Several of the later seventeenth and early eighteenth
century horn books were covered with leather and stamped
in blind, gold, silver, or, in Dutch examples, Dutch metal,
which nearly always turns black, from panel stamps; sometimes
the designs were arabesques or flowers, and at other
times we find figures of saints or kings&mdash;St. George and the
Dragon, mermaids, and the like&mdash;and several of Charles II.
on horseback, the Duke of Cumberland, and other great
people.</p>

<p>These same stamps are also often impressed on paper
backs as well as on leather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>The late cardboard horn books either leave out the cross
at the beginning or replace it by a meaningless X; they also
often show additional alphabets with little wood-cut illustrations.
At last the horn book form is quite lost, and at
last we find folded pieces of cardboard with stamped or
marbled backs, retaining only the alphabet to show that
they are survivals.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="titlefont">LEATHERS.</span></h2>


<p class="chapblock center">Vellum&mdash;Calf&mdash;Pig skin&mdash;Sheep skin&mdash;Goat skin&mdash;Seal skin, etc.</p>

<p>Prepared skins of animals have been the most generally
used of all materials for covering bindings of manuscripts
or printed books. Leather is tanned skin, and the hair is
generally removed. Bindings that have the hair still left on
the leather are usually of an elementary kind and are
intended to be carried about in pockets. They are not
common. Vellum (calf skin), and parchment (sheep skin),
are not tanned, but are prepared with lime and are white.
Not uncommonly, especially in Germany, other skins were
so prepared. Pig skin, deer skin, goat skin, horse skin,
and donkey skin were all “vellumised,” and are all very
strong and take excellent impressions in blind.</p>

<p>It is likely enough that vellum was used for the first
covering of books, simply enclosing the sections, the ends
of the bands drawn in, without boards. Such bindings are
excellent for thin books, and they were successfully re-introduced
in recent times by William Morris, always used with
ties, as otherwise the vellum crinkles up.</p>

<p>“Vellum” bindings made now, unless specially ordered,
are only ordinary bindings in boards covered with vellum.
Vellum is strong, but has some disadvantages. Although
gold looks beautiful upon vellum it is difficult to work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
and title labels do not stick to it well. If kept near the
light it turns to something very like egg-shell and chips off.
This defect was known to librarians in past times, and
they met it by keeping their vellum books backs inwards,
the forages outwards. Many instances of this manner of
keeping vellum books occur in the Bodleian Library at
Oxford, and they generally have their old pressmarks, and
sometimes titles, written across the top of the forage. Old
vellum was cut thick, and seldom ornamented, and if kept
dry in the dark it is an excellent material. The same
peculiarities exist in the case of parchment, which is, however,
a very inferior skin, thinner, weaker, and not so good
looking. Parchment is frequently described, and used, as
vellum, and few purchasers know the difference; but the
market value of parchment is less than half that of vellum.
Vellum is particularly well suited for bindings kept in large
towns, as dust does not stick to it, and it is easily cleaned.
In time it assumes a creamy colour that is delightful.
From the late sixteenth century until now, vellum stained
green has been commonly used in England.</p>

<p>White vellumised leather, probably deer skin, has always
been much liked in England from the time of Henry VIII.,
many of whose books were bound in this material: among
them a copy of Elyot’s “Image of Governance,” printed in
London in 1541, which is one of the first books with gold
tooling upon it done in this country. Several books were
bound in the same thick white leather for the other Tudor
sovereigns, as well as for some of their richer subjects, but
in the seventeenth century limp vellum once more asserted
its sway and became very popular in England for highly
valued books. The brilliancy of the gilding upon some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
these bindings is quite wonderful; it is certainly doubtful if
any modern finishers could equal the technical beauty of
the work. Then in the eighteenth century, vellum, though
still much esteemed, only took its place as a covering for
boards, and once more, in the nineteenth century, Morris
restored it to its proper use as a limp binding.</p>

<p>In 1785, James Edwards of Halifax patented a way of
rendering vellum transparent, so that paintings underneath
it showed through, and he used it with much success. The
process has been revived of late years in England.</p>

<p>The Dutch binders have always liked vellum, but it is
used with boards and never limp. Dutch vellum bindings
are usually coloured, not well done, but at a distance they
look decorative, and were certainly very popular. They
often have clasps and painted edges.</p>

<p>A few bindings have been made in England, France, and
Holland, covered with pierced vellum, showing coloured silk
underneath. They are not very satisfactory and soon get
out of order.</p>

<p>After vellum comes calf, the outer skin of the same
animal, tanned. Calf is a good second, and I think altogether,
up to about the end of the eighteenth century, that
it has been more used than any other leather. The main
difference between old calf and modern calf is that the old
leather was properly tanned with oak bark or sumach, and
cut thick, whereas modern calf used for binding is abominably
tanned, quickly and disastrously, and cut thin. There
is no better leather than old calf, and it was used universally;
England, France, Germany, and Italy all liked it; it was
delightful to decorate, either in blind or gilt, and it mellowed
with age to a rich mahogany brown. Italian and sixteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
century English binders stained their fillets black, and
several of these calf bindings, richly gilded, and with black
fillets, are quite splendid, in perfect taste.</p>

<p>The surface of calf is smooth, and it is very sensitive to
all sorts of stains.</p>

<p>Calf is seen at its best when it is used to take impressions
from panel stamps, but its beautiful surface and sensitiveness
to stains of all kinds has made it a favourite ground
for all sorts of fancy markings, most of which, however
charming they may be at first, end by destroying the
leather.</p>

<p>Russia leather is calf prepared with willow bark and
scented with birch oil. It is a modern leather, and lasts
badly, and is generally diced,&mdash;that is to say, covered all
over with diagonal rulings. It was a favourite leather of
Roger Payne’s. It is said that a book bound in Russia
leather will last better if much used, and no doubt this
is true, not only of Russia but of any other leather.
As a rule leather bindings in libraries are starved; they get
dry, and readily absorb animal oil from the human hand.
The truth of this may be found in the fact that numbers of
dictionaries and books of reference were preferentially
bound in Russia leather some thirty or forty years ago, and
whereas unused books bound at the same time in the
same way now show rotting leather, the reference books
which have been continually used are quite sound and
supple.</p>

<p>Cow hide is like a magnified calf leather, and shows a
slightly pitted surface. It is not often used, but is of much
value for very large books that are worth full binding, as
one piece of hide could be cut large enough, for instance, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
full-bind the <cite>Skibbereen Eagle</cite>, one of the largest Irish
newspapers. It would take three or four of the largest
goat skins to do this, and it is always advisable to avoid
joins, wherever possible, in a binding. But there is one
drawback to the use of hide for binding: it is practically
impossible to cut it smooth; however skilfully it may be
pared, when it gets on the book it is always ridgy. This is,
of course, not very important, but it militates against the use
of hide except when absolutely necessary. For the rest,
hide takes colour well, and it is a very handsome leather,
and when it is finished simply with very broad gold fillets
it is very ornamental.</p>

<p>Pig skin is perhaps the most familiar of all bookbinding
leathers to the outside world, because saddles are made of
it. It is a thick, rich leather, and, so to speak, full of life.
It is not suitable for small books, but very good for large
ones, and has been used in England off and on for a long
time, but never very much. Charles Lewis executed some
fine examples of his larger bindings in pig skin, but I think
he never cared much for it.</p>

<p>Pig skin responds admirably to treatment with lime, the
same method of preparation as used for vellum; and this
white “vellumised” pig skin has always been the most
favoured material for the covering of fine German books of
the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries. Many
of these bindings are perfect in their way, covered all over
with delicate roll stamps showing marvellous definition and
clearness on the hard white surface.</p>

<p>Fine though all their impressions are, it cannot be denied
that they are difficult to see; the impressions are shallow,
and indeed the designs can often be more easily made out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
by help of a rubbing with heelball on soft white paper than
by examining the binding itself.</p>

<p>Pig skin can be recognised by its smooth hard surface,
strongly pitted with bristle holes. It is closely imitated in
inferior leather, bristle holes and all, and when such imitation
is actually on a book it is very difficult to detect, but if
in skin form it can easily be recognised. In real pig skin the
bristle holes penetrate right through the leather, and show
quite as much at the back as they do in the front, whereas
in the imitation they show little, if at all, at the back.
Also the back of real pig skin is of very firm, close texture,
but the imitation shows a more or less woolly or loose
grained back, as it is generally made of sheep skin. French
binders have never favoured pig skin much&mdash;it is not dainty
enough for them.</p>

<p>Sheep skin has always been a favourite leather for bookbinding,
but it is not a fine leather and has never been used
for first-rate binding. It has, however, been more worked
up than anything else into imitations of fine leathers.</p>

<p>The imitation of fine leather in inferior sheep skin has
been for a long time a very important industry, and it
is one which is still with us. All fine leathers show a
particular and well known grain on their surface, but
the most largely imitated is that of goat skin or morocco.</p>

<p>In a well grained skin of morocco, the beautiful grain is
strongly marked, whether it be “pinhole” or “straight”&mdash;so
strongly marked indeed that a cast of it can well be made
in plaster of paris. From such a cast a metal die can be
made, and when this die is strongly pressed upon a prepared
piece of sheep skin, which will take an impression extremely
well, the result is that a surface is produced which is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
exactly like a piece of morocco that even a leather expert
may be, and often is, taken in by it. In course of time,
however, the impression flattens out, and the fraud betrays
itself.</p>

<p>When such a stamped sheep skin is new on a book, and
finished with gold, no one would for a moment suspect its
genuineness, but if in skin form, the back of the leather
will at once betray it. Real morocco has a hard close
grain, but the back of the imitation will show a loose soft
texture. Other leathers are imitated in the same way: pig
skin, lizard skin, and others; and although there has been,
and still is, much of such imitation used in the matter of
bookbindings, there is still more of it used in the furniture
trade.</p>

<p>But putting aside these base uses of sheep skin, it has a
very fair record to show on its own unaided merits. Many
early Italian bindings, good ones, were made in sheep skin;
certainly it has not lasted well, but no doubt when new it
was pleasing enough. In England, many of the early
fifteenth century panel stamp bindings were made in sheep
skin, not quite satisfactory now, but also probably well
enough when new.</p>

<p>It is impossible to say much in favour of modern roan,
the trade name for sheep skin, which has suffered badly at
the hands of the tanner and the dyer; also probably the
binders have not been without fault, as in order to get the
leather flexible for joints and bands they have acquired a
pernicious habit of paring it too thin, and another, equally
hurtful, of unduly pulling and stretching it so that the
fibres, or what is left of them, get strained and broken.</p>

<p>Skiver is part of a split sheep skin, the surface of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
which is altogether artificial. It is much used for cheap
pamphlet bindings and looks well for the moment, but is
not so strong as good paper. It is wonderful how cleverly
the “paste grain” or artificial surface of skiver is made; it
deceives most people easily. The remaining part of a
split sheep skin is prepared quite differently and is made
into “chamois” leather. Although this is not used for
actual bindings, it is often enough made into linings for
loose covers of fine books. It does well for this purpose,
but must be kept in a very dry place as it has a certain
affinity for damp.</p>

<p>The finest of all leathers for binding is goat skin, morocco
as we now call it, from the reputed land of its origin.
“Levant morocco” is still the name of the finest skins.
Goats, however, have of course been common enough all
over the world for ages, and so we find very ancient bindings
in goat skin, quite possibly the most ancient, although I
rather incline to vellum in this connection.</p>

<p>Many of the English twelfth to fourteenth century
blind tooled bindings are in goat skin, tanned brown, most
likely with oak bark, and from that period until now it
has always been used here, at some periods more than
others.</p>

<p>Goat skin always shows small hair dots in groups all over
its surface; it is not quite smooth like calf, and also it
shows certain structural striations. In early goat bindings
both these marks show clearly, and until the time of Roger
Payne in the eighteenth century, the leather was left in its
natural state so far as surface marks went.</p>

<p>Italian bookbinders at an early date saw the beauty of
natural sunk lines on goat skin, and accentuated them by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
rubbing in gold leaf. On such bindings the markings on
the leather show as fine gold lines; it is a pretty idea, and
can often be found on sixteenth century bindings, especially
on those that were made for Tommaso Maioli.</p>

<p>French morocco bindings are frequently stained with
colour, particularly those which were made about the time
of Henri II. in the sixteenth century. The stain is usually
put on the fillets or arabesques surrounding a central
oval, in which is often a painted coat-of-arms. But as a
rule such coloured bindings are in calf, which takes stain
more easily than morocco.</p>

<p>Goat leather has never been so much liked by German
binders as calf or pig skin. This is partly due to the fact
that German bindings are as a rule ornamented with blind
tooling, and goat skin is never satisfactory when treated in
this way: its grain is against it; but for gold tooling, which
has been brought to its greatest perfection by Italian,
French and English binders, there is nothing that gives so
fine a result as goat leather.</p>

<p>Roger Payne saw and liked the natural grain of goat
skin, or, as we may now call it, morocco. But he found
that in many cases he could get a better impression from
his very delicately cut stamps in Russia leather. Here,
however, he was restricted to one colour, and his favourite
colour, a neutral green, could only be procured in morocco.
So he ironed the morocco to flatten its natural hills and
dales, and produced something like what is now called
“crushed” morocco. Payne’s smooth morocco is, however,
not quite our modern “crushed”; it is smoother, because
now we “grain” our leather strongly before crushing it,
whereas Payne ironed his without first increasing its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
natural grain by artificial means. Morocco is often badly
injured by the ironing being done with irons that are too hot.</p>

<p>But Payne went a step farther. No doubt he experimented
much with morocco, and it is likely enough that
before endeavouring to smoothen out his skins he wetted
them thoroughly. If he wetted a fine skin of morocco
overnight and left it alone, perhaps doubling it or rolling it
up, he would have noticed next morning that the natural
grain had become much intensified, due to a slight shrinkage
of the leather, and showed as a particularly effective
breaking up of the surface. Some such chance led him to
make definite experiments with a view to exaggerating the
natural grain of morocco, and he very soon found out
that if a damped skin was well rolled in one direction it
assumed permanently what is now known as a “straight”
grain. That is to say, the surface of the leather is lined in
the same sort of way as a ploughed field is, but not quite
so regularly. The ridges and furrows all run in one
direction. Several of Payne’s bindings are bound in
straight grain morocco, but judging from his own work, he
never got any farther with his graining.</p>

<p>At a later time, I think towards the middle of the nineteenth
century, it was found out that if the process of straight
graining was carried out a second time at right angles to the
first operation, the little straight furrows and ridges were
broken up, and a surface was produced that consisted of a
series of minute hillocks, like a field that has been harrowed,
and this is known as a “pin-head” grain. Both these grainings
improve the strength of the leather, as it contracts
after the wetting and also the wear falls on the tops of the
ridges or hillocks before it reaches the body of the leather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>French binders have always preferred smooth or crushed
morocco for their bindings, as it is easier to gild upon.
Morocco is sensitive to damp, and if affected it quickly
betrays it by giving out the strong scent of goat which is
normally quite absent.</p>

<p>Two new leathers have been recently put upon the
market as rivals of morocco: one of these is seal skin and
the other the skin of the sea-lion.</p>

<p>Seal skin is finished in the same way as morocco and
looks very like it, but it is, I think, not so good. It is
softer, more full of oil and has a peculiar, almost fishy,
smell. The softness of seal leather makes it unfit for
binding books that are likely to have much hard wear, but
the oiliness is probably its worst fault, as books standing
next to it are apt to be stained. But it is undoubtedly a
good-looking and useful leather, and if it can be put upon
the market at a less cost than morocco it is sure to have a
considerable vogue. Sea-lion skin is only fit for use on big
books; it is very strong and is curiously ridged in large
ridges. It has the same oiliness that seal has, but not in
so marked a degree.</p>

<p>There are, of course, several other leathers in which
books have been bound as curiosities, and these are
generally noted in some way; a book in the British Museum
is lettered outside “Kangaroo,” and manuscript notes are
in others telling us in what strange materials they are
covered. Fish skin, known as shagreen, has sometimes
been used for bindings; it is very strong but inelastic, and
soon goes at the joints. In the seventeenth century it was
largely imitated in calf, stamped with a grain.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most curious leather in which any book can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
be bound is human skin. Such treasures are by no means
unknown. It is said that a friend of Camille Flammarion
the French writer, possessed beautiful shoulders, and that
when she died she bequeathed her skin to him as he had
always admired it. He had the skin tanned and used
some of it for a binding of one of his own books, “Ciel et
Terre.” There are other examples in private ownership,
but so far as public libraries are concerned the only
instance I know of is now in the Carnavalet Library at
Paris. It is a copy of the Constitution of 1793, and is
bound in the skin of one of the revolutionaries who was
killed at the time. The skin was tanned at Meudon.
Human skin, undyed, looks like thick calf, and it is most
difficult to get entirely rid of the hair.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that of late years the desire for
beautifully coloured leathers has induced the need for
much treatment before the dyes, mostly aniline, could be
properly applied. In the course of this treatment there
has been an undue use of sulphuric acid, and the presence
of this acid is fatal to the lasting qualities of any leather.
Attention has, however, been drawn to the evil from
authoritative sources, and now sound leathers can be
obtained, and it is to be hoped that the public will second
the endeavours of the committee appointed by the Society
of Arts by always insisting on the use of sound and certified
leather to bind their valuable books in.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="titlefont">THE ORNAMENTATION OF LEATHER BOOKBINDINGS WITHOUT GOLD.</span></h2>


<p class="chapblock">Blind tooling and stamping&mdash;Panel stamps&mdash;Cut leather&mdash;Stained
calf&mdash;Cut vellum&mdash;Transparent vellum.</p>

<p>The true binding of a book consists of the sewing of the
sections on bands, and the covering of leather is really
wanted to protect the threads on the outer surfaces of the
raised bands.</p>

<p>But this is generally taken for granted, and now when
we speak of the binding of a book we normally mean only
the outside ornamentation. In short, the term has changed
its meaning; so in the remainder of this chapter, when I
speak of the “binding” of a book, it is to be understood as
the generally accepted meaning: namely, those parts of the
leather covering that are visible.</p>

<p>From an artistic and æsthetic point of view we are justified
in considering only the final ornamentation of a book
binding. We rightly presume that in all great bindings, and
even in the case of most good bindings, the technical procedures
have all been truly and properly carried out. It is
safe to presume this in the case of all bindings made before
the latter half of the nineteenth century, but I regret to say
that it is not safe to say it of bindings made then and later.
There has been much improper use made of false bands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
false headbands, “sawn in” backs, bad leather, and
scamped sewing of sections even in books costing upwards
of a hundred pounds for their bindings.</p>

<p>The consideration of the ornamentation of leather bindings
without the use of gold is of itself a large study, and
one that has received much attention of late years. In the
trade, ornamental outside work is called “finishing,” as
distinct from the previous work, which is known as the
“forwarding.” As a rule, now, these operations are not
done by the same hands, but a finisher does the finishing
only and makes it his speciality.</p>

<p>Patterns stamped on leather by means of punches or
small dies are found in numbers of early instances on horse
trappings, shoes and boots, and accoutrements of various
sorts; and almost as soon as it was found out that skins of
animals could be rendered soft so as to be wearable, it was
also found out that they could be ornamented by patterns
cut or impressed upon them.</p>

<p>Such patterns are made when the leather is damp and
soft, and on drying they become hard and permanent.
Many of the earlier impressions made on leather bindings
are done by means of hard styles held in the hand and
drawn along the leather. Beautiful Celtic interlacings done
in this way are found in the ancient Irish “polaires” or
book covers. Others are small ornamental stamps which
have been impressed on the leather in the same way as we
now make an ordinary seal.</p>

<p>One of the earliest instances of a leather binding with
ornamental covers is on a Coptic MS. on papyrus, dating
from about the eighth century, which has been originally
stabbed, and the pattern is an interlacing one with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
ornamented fillets, between which are impressions from
small cameo stamps. In time special tools were carefully cut
in hard wood or metal for the avowed purpose of ornamenting
leather bindings. The exact date at which this
occurred it is impossible to say.</p>

<p>So far as Europe is concerned, the earliest known blind
tooled bindings range from about the twelfth century
onwards. Earlier books were either covered with the rich
metal and jewelled mediæval work that I have already
noticed, or else bound in vellum with ties and without
ornamentation.</p>

</div>

<p>In England the art of blind tooling reached its highest
level from the twelfth to the fourteenth century, and, thanks
to the researches of Mr. W. H. J. Weale, there is little doubt
that the English excelled in this art. The Germans succeeded
best after the English, but German work never
approaches the English, either for excellence of general
design or for delicacy and beauty of the small engraved
stamps. The English work was on goat skin or calf, the
German generally on pig skin.</p>

<p>The stamps used in blind tooling&mdash;that is to say, without
gold&mdash;are cut in the same manner as a seal stone is, only
that the cutting is much deeper, and in deep places needs
no finishing. When this is pressed upon the soft, damp
leather, the leather rises up of itself into the deep hollows
cut in the stamp, and so a charming, natural, and apparently
much studied relief is automatically given. Such stamps
are called “cameo” stamps because of this relief.</p>

<p>The general typical arrangements used by England,
Germany, and France in planning out the disposition of
the stamps is a subject that is deserving of careful attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
by any student of blind stamped work. Some valuable
plans of these dispositions can be found in Mr. W. H. J.
Weale’s <cite>Catalogue of Bookbindings and Rubbings of Bindings
in the National Art Library, South Kensington</cite>, and they
are well worthy of study.</p>

<p>Roughly, it will be found that the most elaborate of these
bindings have come from Durham, London, Winchester, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Oxford, that series of close perpendicular lines of small
stamps are characteristic of French early stamped work,
and that the marking out of the boards with large lozenges
is a German plan. But these types must not be studied
alone, as they travelled about freely; the character of the
stamps themselves, as well as the leather used, must all
receive careful consideration.</p>

<p>London bindings often show perpendicular lines of stamps,
sometimes touching, sometimes separate; several of the
stamps are round, and others drop-shaped.</p>

<p>The Winchester Domesday Book, now in the library of
the Society of Antiquaries, is a beautiful and typical specimen
of English twelfth century blind tooling. It is bound
in deep brown goat skin, and each side is differently
ornamented.</p>

<p>The upper board shows an arrangement of two large
circles, largely made up by impressions of the common
English drop-shaped stamps. These circles are flanked
by two rows of rectangular stamps bearing monsters, and the
corners are filled in with circular and drop-shaped stamps.</p>

<p>Durham bindings must be studied at Durham Cathedral,
where Bishop Pudsey’s books are kept. They are twelfth
century work, and splendid examples. On some of these
bindings occur interlacings of basket work designs, borrowed
from the East.</p>

<p>One of the most curious English bindings in existence is
known as St. Cuthbert’s Gospels. Its history is of great
interest. It is a copy of the Gospel of St. John, and is said
to have been buried with St. Cuthbert at Lindisfarne in the
seventh century. The saint’s coffin was shortly afterwards
moved to Durham. The tomb was opened in the reign of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Henry I. in 1105, when the little copy of the Gospel was
found in it, and removed and kept in the treasury at
Durham.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 87.</span>&mdash;English binding of St. Cuthbert’s
Gospels, in embossed leather.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It then passed through many hands, and at last found
a home at Liège,
whence one of the
Jesuit Fathers
brought it to Stonyhurst
College, where
it now is.</p>

<p>The binding is of
thin lime wood
covered with red
leather, the upper
board is ornamented
with a nearly square
central panel bearing
a Celtic scroll in
raised work. Above
and below this are
two rectangular
panels ornamented
with scroll-work impressed
with a style
and coloured by hand
with blue and yellow paint. A narrow border is ornamented
with a twisted line painted yellow. On the lower cover
is a geometrical design drawn in lines and also coloured
yellow.</p>

<p>It is not known what the date of this binding is, and it is
likely enough that the extraordinary state of preservation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
in which it still is may be due either to very careful keeping,
or else that the seventh century work has been carefully
copied on one or other of the many occasions during which
such copy could easily have been made.</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon Duff inclines to about the tenth century, but
I should imagine that the most likely time for such a copy
to be made was when the tomb of St. Cuthbert was opened
in 1105, and the book, then some four hundred years old,
was removed. It is likely enough that the authorities of
the Cathedral library treasury at Durham would have
admired the binding, which was probably much out of
condition, and had it carefully copied in new leather.</p>

<p>Even if it were made then, it would still be the earliest
decorative English binding left, apart from blind tooled
work, and it is undoubtedly a most decorative and effective
example. But it is permissible to think and hope that
at all events it preserves the colour and designs of the
seventh century binding, which was the first cover of the
old manuscript.</p>

<p>Another very early English binding, covering a Latin
Psalter of the early twelfth century with interlinear Saxon
version, is now kept in the British Museum among the
Stowe collection.</p>

<p>It is bound in oaken boards nearly an inch thick, the
central portion of which is hollowed into a rectangular
depression. On the lower board is a bronze figure of our
Lord in the attitude of the Crucifixion. The figure has
been gilded, but most of the gold has now worn off. The
corners have small bosses set in triangular pieces of thin
metal, which are impressed with a design of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fleur-de-lys</i>
in outline within a circle. The boards are covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
brown leather, much worn and faded, probably deer
skin, and the brass fastenings for a clasp still remain <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in
situ</i>.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 88.</span>&mdash;English binding of the twelfth century,
with bronze figure of Christ.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The history of the book is as curious as the book itself;
there are several manuscript notes in it, and also much
has been written about it.</p>

<p>It appears to be the original book on which our sovereigns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
took their coronation oath, and it seems to have been
so used from the coronation of Henry I. to that of
Henry VII.</p>

<p>Powell in his <cite>Repertory of Records</cite> mentions this as a
fact, and it was repeated by Thos. Madox, historiographer,
and also by Thos. Astle, Keeper of the Records in the Tower
of London, to whom it belonged, and it is believed to have
been written and bound for the coronation of Henry I.</p>

<p>From the library of Thomas Astle the little book passed
into the possession of the Marquis of Buckingham, and was
kept at Stowe in a beautiful Gothic room built for a
library. In June, 1849, the Stowe library changed hands
and became the property of Lord Ashburnham, and
in 1883 it was acquired by the Trustees of the British
Museum.</p>

<p>So the coronation book is now the property of the nation,
and in company with the greater part of the Stowe library,
but the Irish MSS., some of them in beautiful bindings,
went to Ireland, where they are now safely kept in the
library of the Royal Irish Academy.</p>

<p>Caxton’s styles of binding are not distinctively English
in character. The reason for this is that in all probability
he brought foreign stamps and styles with him when he
returned from Bruges and set up in Westminster in 1477.
So the few blind stamped bindings that appear to have
issued from Caxton’s workshop bear the diamond-shaped
spaces characteristic of foreign work, filled with impressions
for cameo stamps, often triangular. Wynkyn de Worde
used the same stamps.</p>

Caxton. (1491.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>White deer skin bindings were used much in England in
the fifteenth century; they were unornamented, and usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
had small clasps. A fine copy of the Book of St. Albans, in
a contemporary binding of this kind, was recently sold by
Mr. Quaritch.</p>

<p>A curious treatise in bookbinding, the earliest known, is
in the Bibliothèque Nationale; but there are two treatises by
John Bagford which may be of about the same date, early
in the eighteenth century. These treatises have been
published by the Bibliographical Society, and are full of
interesting matter. Bagford mentions inscriptions on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
stone, “slate books,” or diptychs, paste-boards, sewing,
headbands, covers, bosses, clasps, horn books, and gives
curious rules for collating, folding, and binding.</p>

<p>At Oxford fine blind tooled bindings were produced in
considerable numbers. In the fifteenth century Theodoric
Rood and Thomas Hunt did fine work, and in the seventeenth,
Dominick Pinart and Edward Miles were especially
prominent. The main characteristic of early Oxford
bindings is the presence of small rectangular stamps closely
arranged in rows.</p>

<p>Cambridge has also been notable among English towns
for the production of fine blind tooled bindings. The main
characteristic of these bindings may, perhaps, be considered
to be the existence of rolls on which are variations of the
Royal Tudor badges, rose, fleur-de-lys, portcullis, the castle
of De Beaufort, and the pomegranate. Larger rolls have
devices of monsters, and frequently the initials of the
binders may be found.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century the works of Garrett Godfrey,
Nicholas Spierinck and John Siberch are, perhaps, most
usually met with. They show the initials of their respective

<p>Blind tooled bindings of French origin are numerous
enough, especially those impressed with panel stamps.
The main characteristic of early work is the existence of
perpendicular lines of blind tooling, but although this
peculiarity is oftener found on French work than on any
other, it is by no means unknown in bindings made by
English and German workmen, so must not be taken as an
absolute proof of French origin if unsupported by other
evidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>Late in the fifteenth century the panel stamp was
invented in Holland, or the Netherlands, and it soon
attained a great measure of popularity. It reached
England in the early part of the sixteenth century, and
although at first foreign dies were freely used here, in time
our native binders made
their own.</p>

<p>In France and Germany
panel stamps were also
popular, used on calf bindings,
but I think that in
Italy it never made much
headway.</p>

<p>The Netherlands panel
stamps often have the names
of the binders upon them,
Bollcaert, Bloc, and many
more, and the same valuable
information is also
often found on French panel
stamps of the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>The best known names are
André Boule, Jean Moulin,
R. Macé, and Denis Roce. All these are plentiful, and
are often found in excellent condition. The English
panel stamps do not bear names upon them, but
they often have initials, but whether it is safe to interpret
these is difficult to say. We generally consider that J. R.
stands for John Reynes, I. N. for Jean Norins, R. L. for
Richard Lant, G. G. for Garrett Godfrey, R. P. for Richard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Pynson, and so on; but it is probable, anyhow, that
although panel stamps of English design bearing these
initials were used here, they were largely of foreign,
probably Netherlandish,
origin.</p>

</div>

<p>In the early sixteenth
century in
England, heraldry
was an important
science, and began
to show itself as
a fertile source of
ornamentation of
bindings. Many of
the panel stamps
of the early Tudor
period are heraldic.
The most interesting
of these stamps
is one which is
found in combination
with several
others; it seems
to be a sort of
backbone. The
design consists of a large Tudor rose, partly enclosed by
ribbon on which is the legend <span class="smcap">HEC ROSA VIRTUTIS DE
CŒLO MISSA SERENO ETERNUM FLORENS REGIA SCEPTRA
FERET</span>.</p>

<p>At the side are two angels and in the corners the arms of
London and the Cross of St. George.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Then there are numbers of other stamps bearing in the
centre the coat-of-arms of Henry VII. and Henry VIII. up
to 1526, namely, France and England quarterly, with
supporters, the red dragon of Cadwallader and the white
greyhound of De Beaufort.</p>

<p>Belonging to the same school of design are fine panel
stamps bearing the armorial devices of Anne Boleyn and
Queen Katharine Parr.</p>

</div>

<p>The question as to whether these stamps are royal or
not inevitably occurs to any student, but as with one or two
exceptions they carry with them extraneous ornament, such
as the sun and moon, and arms of London, I think that
any such stamp cannot have been royal, but it is possible
enough that when the royal arms alone are found the
stamp may have been originally cut for royalty. Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
stamps as these are very strong and are not likely to have
ever been worn out&mdash;indeed, it is curious that instances of
unauthorised use
of royal stamps is
not commoner than
it is.</p>

<p>One of the most
curious of these
panel stamps, not
armorial, is one
which bears upon
it the device of
John Reynes. It
shows a fancy coat-of-arms
on which
are the emblems
of the Passion,
with two unicorns
as supporters, a
royal helmet,
above which are
scourges, &amp;c., and
a crowing cock,
and below on a
ribbon the words
“Arma redemptoris mundi.” One cannot forget here that
Dame Juliana Berners, in the Boke of Cote Armour, declares
the Christ was a gentleman of coat armour by right of his
mother Mary.</p>

</div>

<p>The English panel stamps, as well as rolls, of the early
Tudor period often bear the Tudor badges of double or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Tudor rose, the fleur-de-lys, and the portcullis of the
De Beauforts. These badges are usually crowned.</p>

<p>Panel stamps were cut on latten, a metal alloy resembling
brass. The thin engraved plate was fixed on a wooden
block by means of two pegs, and the impression was made
on the leather either by the use of a hammer or by means
of weights, very likely by a combination of both these,
methods.</p>

<p>After a time the pegs worked loose, and very frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
panel stamps are found in which the impression from these
loosened pegs can be seen.</p>

<p>Many German calf bindings of the fourteenth, fifteenth,
and sixteenth centuries are beautifully ornamented with
cut work. The outlines of the designs are cut with a sharp
small knife held slantingly,
and afterwards worked into
shape with blunted tools.
The designs upon these
bindings are often very
fine, and the workmanship
is most skilled and effective.
The earliest example
I know of is elaborately
ornamented on the upper
board with a groundwork
of floral scrolls, and has
in the centre the Austrian
coat-of-arms supported on
an eagle, which is stained
black. On a scroll above
the eagle are the words
“Fridericus rex, etc., 1451”
and below it in a long panel
the letters “A E I O U,” standing for the proud motto
“Austria est imperare orbi universo.” Along the lower
edge is cut the name of the binder, “Petrus Ligator.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hunting scenes and scenes of religious life are usually
found on these early German cut leather bindings, now and
then, as in the case of the splendid sixteenth century copy
of Ranierus de Pisa’s <cite>Pantheologia</cite>, now in the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Museum, showing a monk at his
desk; the borders are ornamented with
small stamps. Cut leather bindings
are done with consummate skill, and
must always have been very costly,
so we find that they were, and are,
very cleverly imitated by skilfully
cut stamps. An example of this is
so well done that it has over and
over again been described as hand
work, but in fact it is only a stamp.
German leather workers are still pre-eminent
in this small cut manner.
At the St. Louis Exhibition of 1904, in the German section
there were several examples of cut leather work done in
exactly the same way as the fifteenth century work&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
quite as good. It is not only used for book bindings but
also to cover boxes and small articles, but as we have noted
in the case of earlier work, many modern apparently hand-cut
German leathers are really only impressions from large
panel stamps.</p>

</div>

<p>Notable among German bindings are those made by
John Richenbach, of Gyslingen, who lettered and dated
many of his fine volumes. The dates run from 1467
onwards. There is one fine example
in the British Museum; it is like all
the rest, in pig skin, and stamped
in blind, a little transparent colour
being put over many of the stamps.
Round the outer borders of the
boards runs the inscription in large
black letters:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">ILLIGATA PER ME IO. RICHENBACH
CAPELLANU IN GYSLINGEN, 1475.</span></p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 98.</span>&mdash;German binding,

</div>

<p>All Richenbach’s bindings are still
thoroughly strong and good, and
the small touch of colour upon
them redeems them from the monotony of colour which is
so marked in the later German bindings in white pig skin.</p>

<p>German blind tooled bindings are very numerous, as the
art was always much liked by German binders, and whereas
both in England and in France blind tooling and stamping
quickly gave way before the more beautiful and popular
art of gold tooling, in Germany the quieter blind work has
retained its supremacy. German binders never took kindly
to gold tooling, and when they had to do it they generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
used bad metal. Most early German gold tooled work is
now badly discoloured for this reason.</p>

</div>

<p>German bindings in calf are usually designed with a
central panel crossed by diagonals at considerable intervals,
and in the diamonds thus formed are impressions of various
stamps. On white pig skin, however, are to be found the
most characteristic of the German blind tooled works. We
find large books elaborately ornamented with impressions
of finely cut “cameo” rolls, and
having a centre panel stamp showing
the portrait of some notable person,
or a coat-of-arms. The rolls are
worthy of much attention, as they
are very carefully designed and
beautifully cut. They show an infinite
variety of designs, and may
be roughly divided into two classes,
namely, those showing human figures,
busts in profile, and those only bearing
floral or arabesque designs.
Among the former there is a long
series of allegorical figures, all with
their respective emblems, and often lettered and dated.
There are Faith, Hope and Charity; Sweetness, Prudence,
Justice; figures of the Evangelists, Christ, David, St. Paul,
Lucretia, and heads of the reformers, Luther, Melancthon
and Hus particularly.</p>

<p>Some of the German panel stamps are very large, also
numerous and finely cut. There are splendidly executed
stamps of Charles V. and other distinguished personages,
emperors and grand dukes, Rudolf and many others, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
others of Luther and Melancthon. Some of these are set
in an arabesque framing with a space left in the middle
for an insertion. These are found impressed on calf and
on pig skin, and the dies of many of them are most
beautifully cut.</p>

<p>Several of the later calf bindings, done in the eighteenth
and nineteenth century, show an infinite variety of
marblings, sprinklings and “tree” patternings, done with
one or other of the most appropriate chemicals&mdash;potash,
soda, oxalic acid&mdash;run on when the leather is wet. But
one and all of these rot away the surface wherever they
touch it, and many of these books can now be found from
which the original dyed spots have all entirely disappeared,
leaving, however, a little eaten-out depression in every case.</p>

<p>James Edwards, of Halifax, invented a style of ornamenting
calf by means of ordinary book stamps loaded with
acid. The result is not unpleasing, and such books are
known as “Etruscan,” because many of the designs are of
classical feeling&mdash;little urns, the Greek fret and the like.
But Edwards’ little acid burnt designs are only used as
accessories; there is plenty of gold work and ordinary blind
work upon them as well.</p>

<p>John Whitaker, another eighteenth century binder, went
a step further, and drew designs upon his calf bindings
with pen or brush. Some of these are very effective, but
as a rule they are now showing the effects of time, the
original darkest places, where the acid has been most freely
applied, suffering first, and showing the pale calf underneath.
But a fine specimen of Whitaker’s work is much to be
prized. He also used the “Etruscan” style. He had
many imitators, but whereas Whitaker’s bindings are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
generally ornamented with figure drawings, the imitators
as a rule preferred easier subjects&mdash;ruins or landscapes.</p>

<p>Calf with the rough side outwards, like brown velvet, was
used in England from the seventeenth to the nineteenth
century, sometimes tooled in blind and sometimes in gold.</p>

<p>Vellum was used at Little Gidding. One such book is
covered in vellum painted orange colour and overlaid with
openwork designs cut in white vellum. It is a harmony of
the Gospels. The centre design is circular, and the corners
have quarter circles. They are all helped with a little gold
tooling.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries several small
French and Dutch books were prettily ornamented with
vellum cut in openwork patterns. Underneath the open
places bits of coloured silk are laid. They are dainty but
not very successful, as small edges and points of the vellum
are apt to curl up and catch.</p>

<p>James Edwards, of Halifax, invented a curious way of
making vellum transparent, and patented it in 1785. The
vellum had to be soaked in pearlash and subjected to
various processes, pressure among them, and cut very thin
indeed, so as to be more like goldbeater’s skin than anything
else. Then the books were covered with fine white
paper and painted, generally in monotone, but sometimes
in colour, and over this painting the transparent vellum
was skilfully fixed. The result is that, except when the
thin vellum is cracked or seen through, the painting
underneath is as fresh as ever it was; but it is to be
presumed that there is not much wearing strength in
Edwards’ vellum, chiefly because of its extreme thinness.
But as a rule any fine examples of his work, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
as they look dainty and precious, have always been well
kept and highly valued, and are in good and clean condition.
Some modern binders have essayed Edwards’ plan
with a certain measure of success.</p>

<p>Impressions of designs in low relief were made on thin
leather bindings by means of engraved cylinders in the
earlier half of the nineteenth century. They were chiefly
used in the small and beautifully illustrated periodicals
which were so popular in England&mdash;<cite>The Age</cite>, <cite>Friendship’s
Offering</cite>, and many more&mdash;issued during the earlier half of
the nineteenth century and a little after it. Charming
designs in cameo are often found in these cases, on paste-boards
covered with thin leather, but they are nearly always
rubbed badly in projecting places. Some of the best of
these designs are by Remnant and Edmonds, Smith Elder
&amp; Co., and De La Rue &amp; Co.</p>

<p>The art of gold tooling on leather appears to have been
known in Eastern countries before it was known in the West.
There are signs of it in Saracenic work of the early fifteenth
century, but it cannot be quite certain whether much of
this work was not simply painted with gold. If a blind
line is carefully painted with gold shell and then burnished
with a fine agate, a gilded line can be made that looks
nearly as well as a properly gold tooled line. No doubt a
considerable proportion of early gold tooling was done in
this way, and some of it was not even burnished.</p>

<p>Some early Venetian bindings show gold spaces gilded
with gold leaf in a very effective way, and in the Bodleian
some English panel stamps of the early sixteenth century
are gilded all over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_206.jpg" width="300" height="471" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 100.</span>&mdash;Italian gold tooled binding,
1514.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There is little doubt that gold tooling, done as it is now,
was known to the Venetians towards the end of the fifteenth
century. It is a curious art, and depends for its wonderful
strength upon the fact that albumen hardens with heat.
The method used is simple: a stamp is impressed in blind
on the leather, and then
the impression is painted
over with glaire of egg&mdash;albumen.
When the albumen
is dry it is again
painted over with palm oil
or cocoa-nut oil, and on
this a piece of gold leaf is
laid. The stamp is now
heated, and when it is of
the proper temperature it
is very carefully reimpressed
in exactly the
same place as at first.</p>

<p>The heat of the stamp
congeals the albumen
under the gold, and the now
gilded impression is likely
enough to be the strongest
part of the leather. I have
often found old leather bindings badly worn away, but the
gold tooled work and lettering still remaining in places.
Thus, instead of being <em>impressed</em>, as it originally was, it is
all in <em>relief</em>, because the albumen has soaked into the leather
a little and then been hardened, so that instead of gilded
hollows we find little mountains with golden tops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>But to counterbalance this possible advantage, the
albumen presents a weak point. On an old gold tooled
binding it is not uncommon to find that a golden curve is
partly gone; half of it perhaps shows no longer as a
thin gold line, but only as a shallow trench, hollowed
out of the leather. The meaning of this is that the
albumen provides a nourishing meal for some small grub,
which, once it gets the trail, will follow it, if not disturbed
half over the book, and with wonderful accuracy will eat
away gold, albumen, and a little leather, following curves,
leaves, and letterings with close fidelity.</p>

<p>This particular damage is most liable to occur in instances
where books are laid down in show cases on cloth or velvet
and not often moved. The soft groundwork allows the
grub more freedom than if the book is standing up closely
packed with others on a shelf.</p>

<p>The small gilt roundels found on early Persian and Arabic
bindings as well as on early Venetian work, were set with
some sort of gesso under the gold.</p>

<p>The trade of Venice with the East brought these matters
of ornamented leather to the notice of Venetian bookbinders,
and these, men of consummate taste, at once saw the
possibilities of the new art. Indeed, the Italian gold tooled
bindings of the late fourteenth century are the finest that
have ever yet been made, even though many of them are
quite Oriental in feeling and others very strongly so. But
the Venetians soon crept away from the Eastern trammels
and evolved beautiful styles of their own. One of the
first of these styles was the careful mingling of blind
tooled lines with gilded lines; another was the use of
small gilded roundels&mdash;themselves an Oriental idea&mdash;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
connection with blind tooling and blind tooling coloured
by hand.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 101.</span>&mdash;Cameo stamp of Apollo and Pegasus found on binding that
belonged to D. Canevari. Italian, sixteenth century.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Then at an early date the Italians hit upon the effective
use of so-called “cameo” stamps. These were sometimes
cut on a flat piece of metal, as the “Canevari” stamps are,
and sometimes on a bossed piece of metal, as the Alexander
and Cæsar are. When on the binding these stamps show
as a depression with the design in relief within it.</p>

<p>Many of the smaller stamps of this period are worthy of
notice. There is the “Arabic” knot, used on Aldine
binding and derived from an Oriental original from basket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
work, as many of the early stamps are, the Florentine leaf
and the Aldine dolphin.</p>

</div>

<p>Then there is no doubt that many of the finest of the
bindings made for Jean Grolier were Italian. Who designed
them and who bound
them we do not know,
but among the earlier
examples there is no
doubt that splendid work
can be found. They may
have been done in the
workshop of Aldus
Manutius, but it rather
seems that the designs
were made by one man,
and I think it is not
unlikely that Grolier
himself may have always
given the general idea
of the decoration he
wanted.</p>

<p>The later bindings
made for Grolier are
curiously inferior, and
sometimes in calf. The
earlier and finer bindings
are in morocco, which is sometimes marbled. The
words “<span class="smcap">Grolierii et Amicorum</span>” are always put upon such
bindings as were made for him, and the legend “<span class="smcap">Portio
mea domine sit in terra viventium</span>” also generally
appears in the centre of one or other of the boards.</p>

</div>

<p>Whenever Grolier acquired a book which was already
very finely bound he added his autograph either on the
flyleaf at the beginning or at the end. Grolier was the first
collector to have his books bound in a particular way for
himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“Grolier” bindings have been very freely imitated,
especially by a native of Bologna, who worked a good deal
for Count Guglielmo Libri, a great collector, and unfortunately
the style lends itself well to imitation. A
fraudulent finisher looks out for an old Italian book of the
right date, bound in plain leather. Then he copies parts
from one or other of the many Groliers which can be seen
and studied by any Londoner or Parisian for the asking,
and if he is fairly clever at his trade it will take a very
skilled expert to detect the fraud. Many such imitations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
are about, and every day they become more like genuine
examples.</p>

<p>The styles of binding that have been most largely and
successfully imitated are those made for Jean Grolier,
Henri II. and of his period, and the so-called “Canevari”
bindings.</p>

<p>From Italy the art of gold tooling rapidly spread through
Europe, and took hold particularly in England and France.
There is no doubt that an Italian gilder came to England
and taught Thomas Berthelet, binder and printer to
Henry VIII. Not only are numbers of Berthelet’s stamps
of distinctly Italian character, but in many of his lists of
books he describes particular examples as being bound
“after the Italian fascion.” But Berthelet quickly enough
evolved a style of his own. It appears to me that English
binders have from the time of Berthelet until now
succeeded better than those of any other nation in the
ornamentation of large books. In small books the palm
must be given to Italian and French binders, but large
books have always puzzled the best of these, and even
Le Gascon has not been successful with them.</p>

<p>Many of the large books bound by Thomas Berthelet are
as fine as any such books can be. His best work was,
naturally enough, done for royalty, but he set the fashion
for smaller binders, and although there is a want of minute
finish and technical accuracy in everything he did,
Berthelet’s fine work will always give him a place in the
first rank of bookbinders of this or any other country.</p>

</div>

<p>After Berthelet’s time gold tooling became general in
England, but the binders who used it are anonymous.
There are some fine calf bindings with inlays of white
leather which were made in the reign of Queen Elizabeth,
on which appear the initials I. D. P., perhaps “John Day
Pegit,” and which are credited to John Day, but it is by no
means certain that they were done by that eminent printer.
The style of leather bindings of Elizabeth’s reign departed
finally from that of Berthelet, and more variety is found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
than at any other period. The Oriental fashion of double
boards was re-introduced, the centre panels being filled
with delicate paintings, portraits or coat-of-arms, and the
remainder of the boards variously ornamented with inlays
of white leather, toolings in gold and silver, and impressions
from stamps cut in arabesques. Some of these bindings are
coloured, that is to say, the arabesques, curves or flowers
are painted by hand with some kind of enamel paint. The
main source of such coloured bindings was Lyons, from
which centre numbers of them were issued, but the fashion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
was one which appealed to the English liking for colour,
and many fine examples, often heraldic, were made here.
In royal bindings at all times heraldry has played an
important part, but from the middle of the sixteenth
century onwards it plays an equally important part on
bindings made for ordinary armigerous people.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 107.</span>&mdash;Italian inlaid and gold tooled binding

</div>

<p>Letterings often appear on the sides of bindings of the
Tudor period, mottoes, initials and names. Towards the
end of the sixteenth century a few bindings are found on
which are semis of triple dots. This is the beginning of
the style which reached its ultimate form in the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
century. Also small triangular corner stamps occur now
and then. These also developed and eventually became
one of the most characteristic marks of Jacobean bindings.</p>

<p>When James VI. of Scotland came here as our James I.
he may have brought with him John Gibson, who was his
binder in Scotland. Lists of books bound by this binder
still exist, but no book or binding mentioned by him has so
far been identified. But there are some remarkable books
among those which were certainly bound for James I.
which are not like the general type of his bindings, and it
is likely enough that these may be Gibson’s work. The
style is a very fine one, and the workmanship strong and
good, but not, in my opinion, correct enough to have been
done by a foreign binder. The same binder did some of
the re-binding for Henry Prince of Wales, and one of its
characteristics is a dotted fillet of double lines.</p>

<p>It is probable that many of the richer bindings of the early
seventeenth century were the work of John and Abraham
Bateman, the king’s printers and binders, but, in spite of
lists, this is again only speculation. There is no doubt
that about this time many bindings were made which
would now be called trade bindings as apart from art
bindings. Trade bindings often enough follow art bindings
at a respectable distance, and they are rarely made on
original lines.</p>

<p>Following the lead given by some of the later Elizabethan
bindings, we find from about 1603 to 1625 a considerable
output of very showy bindings, with elaborate semis or
powderings of small stamps all over the groundwork, very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
large and over-elaborated corner stamps and centres of
arabesque or heraldic motives.</p>

<p>Students of English royal bindings must note that with
the coming of James I. to the English throne, a great
change was made in the English coat-of-arms. The coat
which had been used from the time of Edward III., namely,
France and England quarterly, was now used as a quartering
only, and shows in the first and fourth quarters. In
the second quarter we find the ancient coat of Scotland, or,
a lion rampant within a double tressure flory counterflory
gu., and in the third quarter comes the coat of Ireland, az.,
the harp of Apollo Grian, stringed ar, <em>or</em>., given, it is supposed,
by Henry VIII. as a mark of admiration for the
musical excellence of the Irish.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 448px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 112.</span>&mdash;English gold-tooled binding made

</div>

<p>Also the late Tudor supporters of the lion and dragon
give place to the familiar lion and unicorn. The unicorn
is one of the ancient supporters of the Scottish coat. It is
interesting to note in passing that the present official coat
of Scotland is, first and fourth Scotland, second England,
and third Ireland, with two unicorns as supporters. It
appears on Scottish official bindings. The interpretation
of this is of course that England and Ireland are appanages
of Scotland.</p>

<p>But even if it is now correct to dissociate the arms of
England and Scotland, we must not forget the heraldic
marriage between the two countries which took place in
1706, on which auspicious occasion the two coats were
impaled as one. That is to say, they were treated in the
same way as the coats of married people.</p>

<p>The semis, with large corners, is a manner which has lasted
a long time, but it is not a great style; it is, however, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
which has been largely followed in the case of trade bindings.
In this manner a very rich and brilliant effect can be produced
with a minimum of real design and of technical skill.
The centres of such bindings, if not simply coats-of-arms,
are always of oval outline, but at Little Gidding the irregular
Jacobean corners and oval centres turned into circular
centres and quarter-circle corners. The gold tooled leather
bindings made at Little Gidding followed closely in detail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
those made by Thomas and John Buck, the Cambridge
University printers, but in the main the bindings made
by Mary Collet and her assistants were original. In the
matter of semis also the Little Gidding bindings show a
pleasant departure from the quite regular arrangements
aimed at by Jacobean binders.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 113.</span>&mdash;English inlaid and gold tooled binding

</div>

<p>After 1625 the series and corners tended gradually to fall
into abeyance, and although they did not altogether disappear,
they were each modified. Corner pieces became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
smaller in proportion, and the semis more artistically
irregular.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the reign of Charles I. some unknown
binder, probably Samuel Mearne, had the hardihood for
the first time to bind royal books without any ornamentation
on the boards except a coat-of-arms. The red leather,
goat skin, used on these bindings is of extremely fine colour
and quality. Simplicity in ornamentation
of bookbindings is
usually accompanied by fine leather,
and at no time has this been
more noticeable than in the case of
Mearne’s simpler work.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 114.</span>&mdash;Book stamp of

</div>

<p>The political troubles of the later
half of the seventeenth century may
of themselves have tended to incline
bookbinders to simplify their work,
and so also may the Puritan spirit
of the time. State bindings of the
time are studiously simple, and bear
upon them a device with shields,
showing the English cross of St. George and the harp of
Ireland side by side, impressed upon black leather.</p>

<p>But there were other very decorative small bindings
being produced in considerable numbers about this period.
Whether these also owed their existence to Samuel Mearne
is still uncertain, but he was, I expect, a moving spirit in
the matter of fine bookbindings from the end of the reign
of Charles I. to the end of the reign of Charles II. The
little books I allude to were made during the latter half of
the seventeenth century and are always bound in black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
morocco. They have inlays of red, yellow, and white
leather upon them and some very well designed gold tooling.
Many of the designs are in detail similar to those which
were certainly used at a later time by Samuel Mearne. John
Bagford, in a curious account of book binding written early
in the eighteenth century, mentions a workman named
Suckerman, who was “one of the best workmen that ever
took tool in hand, and commonly worked for Mr. Merne
the Binder to King Charles the 2.”</p>

<p>It is quite possible that much of the finest English work
of this period was done by this man, but I expect he was
only a workman, and executed the designs made out for
him by a skilled designer&mdash;possibly enough Mearne
himself.</p>

</div>

<p>Samuel Mearne was appointed royal binder to Charles II.,
and he was the second great binder in England. Mearne
bound the majority of his books in the same beautiful red
leather that I have already mentioned as being used for
some late bindings belonging to Charles I., and the same
coat-of-arms occurs on some of those bound for Charles II.
This red leather was probably dyed with cochineal. Before
this no red leather was used to any extent in England.
Brown, olive, blue, and black were all common, but not
red. The ordinary bindings made by Mearne for Charles II.
were simply and tastefully ornamented with rectangular
lines having the royal initials at the corners, but others are
more elaborate.</p>

<p>We owe a national design to Mearne’s inventive genius,
and it is known as the “Cottage” style. The gold-lined
parallelogram is the starting point, and the upper and lower
lines are broken outwards into a gable form. From this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
starting point Mearne developed his further decoration with
supreme success, until indeed he succeeded in producing
some of the finest bindings for large books that have ever
been made. Not only that, Mearne’s style and even the
details of his stamps continue until the present time, and
the Bible on which
King Edward VII.
took the coronation
oath was bound in
the Cottage style.
No style has ever
lasted so long, not
only in England,
but in any other
country.</p>

<p>There was yet
another beautiful
style invented by
Mearne. It is not
so real a design as
the Cottage, as it
partakes to some
extent of the principle
of the semis,
inasmuch as symmetrical
repetition is an integral part of it. There is
no doubt that Mearne saw and admired the work of the
great French contemporary binder Le Gascon, and from
him he borrowed several ideas, among them that of the
pointille or dotted stamps, and also that of the interlacing
fillets with interstitial spaces filled with small gold tooling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>The radical change that Mearne made with regard to Le
Gascon’s interlacing fillets was that he made them up by
using successive impressions
of a two-horned
curve instead
of a continuous fillet
or ribbon. Although
at first sight there
would seem to be no
connection between
one of these “all
over” bindings by
Mearne and one of
Le Gascon’s exquisite
little interlacings, I
think the connection
is undoubted.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 117.</span>&mdash;English gold-tooled binding in
“all-over” style, by Samuel Mearne.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The all-over bindings,
always small,
are not uncommon;
they are in black or
red morocco, with
colours interchanged,
and are tooled in gold,
with the very decorative
addition of silver paint, water-colour, applied by hand
here and there.</p>

<p>Eliot and Chapman did much excellent work in the
eighteenth century and invented large ornamental borders
for their bindings. These borders are not rolls, but the component
parts are separately stamped. There is an excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
design with arches, a bird and a fly, and another with a
globe, but all of them are admirably and effectively designed.</p>

<p>Except the work of Eliot and Chapman, the main English
ornamentations on bookbindings during the eighteenth
century were modifications of one or other of Mearne’s
designs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>Eliot and Chapman bound largely for Robert Harley,
first Earl of Oxford, and their broad bordered style is known
as the “Harleian.” The centres, in the finest examples,
are left unornamented, but there are numbers of examples,
especially in later work, in which the centres are filled with
a diamond-shaped mass of small gold toolings. Their style
has been very largely copied.</p>

</div>

<p>Towards the end of the eighteenth century English
binding received a remarkable stimulus by reason of the
advent of Roger Payne, a native of Windsor, who set up
in London as a bookbinder about 1770.</p>

<p>Payne’s two predecessors, Berthelet and Mearne, had both
enjoyed Court positions, but Payne never did; he worked
when he chose, and only then, and even if the brilliancy
and genius shown of his work had ever been known to
George III., it is doubtful whether so unreliable a man as
Payne was could ever have been allowed to hold any
responsible position.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 426px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 120.</span>&mdash;English gold tooled binding, by
Roger Payne.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The main charm of Payne’s work consists in the spare
ornamentation of beautiful leather with exquisitely designed
and cut stamps. These stamps are said to have been cut by
himself in iron, but most of them were certainly of brass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
One of Payne’s stamps only is specially cut so as to be
capable of being used in combination; it is a little sprig of
vine, and he used it not only by itself, but sometimes so as
to make an entire vine oval on the side of a book. Payne
was also the first great English binder to pay much attention
to the inside of the boards of his bindings. His “Doublures,”
as they are called, often show more elaborate work than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
exists outside the books. The masses of small stamps which
occur on the borders of the fine doublures and in the
corners of Payne’s bindings are arranged in parallel lines,
but have little constructive arrangement. The brilliancy
of Payne’s gold tooling has never been exceeded.</p>

<p>In his simpler bindings Payne used a deep soft purple
end paper, usually lined with gold round the edge. The
leather joint red or green is also often gilded, and shows a
stitch or two of the silk thread which Payne always used.
The headbands are small and rounded, of green silk, with
sometimes a gold thread here and there.</p>

<p>The colours of Payne’s moroccos are deep blue, deep red,
orange, deep olive, or pale sea-green. If other colours are
found on bindings apparently by him, I should begin by
suspecting the work is that of Richard Wier. His Russia
leathers are always dull brown in colour, and diced.
Payne lined his backs too thickly, and his books often
open stiffly. This is not of much importance when the
binding is morocco, but when Russia leather is used it
causes it to break at the joints. Some of the designs in
the back panels of Payne’s more decorative bindings are
quite admirable. His moroccos are smooth or straight-grained,
a method of treating the leather that he invented.
Payne often added a manuscript note to his bound work
and pasted it in the beginning. Several of these notes are
of great interest, as they show the immense care and trouble
he took to do the best he could in every case. They are
also of the greatest value in showing that certain pieces of
work are unquestionably from his own hand.</p>

<p>Richard Wier, a Scottish bookbinder, worked with Payne,
and closely copied his style. Wier was fonder of blind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
tooling than Payne was, and they used the same stamps.
Many of the bindings credited to Roger Payne are really by
Wier, who, as well as Mrs. Wier, was a highly skilled mender
of books.</p>

<p>Charles Hering founded his styles upon those of Payne,
but soon evolved a manner of his own. He finished some
books that Payne had left unfinished in the same style.
Originals and copies are now in the Rylands Library at
Manchester. Hering’s work is, however, only high class
trade binding, as is that of his contemporary, C. Kalthœber.
Both Hering’s and Kalthœber’s work is often signed, either
in small gilt or blind lettering along the lower edge of one
of the boards, or by an affixed ticket.</p>

<p>Kalthœber frankly copied Payne’s styles and stamps, but
elaborated both so much that he quite lost sight of the
characteristic simplicity of the great master. Kalthœber
bound several books for George III., and many of them are
decorative enough, and if they had not been such parodies
of Payne’s work they would no doubt have taken high
rank.</p>

<p>Staggemeier and Walther were both Germans, who worked
much in the same manner as Kalthœber. They both signed
their bindings.</p>

<p>Charles Lewis was very nearly a great binder, but I do
not think he quite reached that level. He used flat double
bands with gold tooling upon them, but these are frequently
only shams, and are in company with hollow backs. After
that his best work was borrowed; but his bindings are
always pleasant to handle and admirably forwarded and
finished. Lewis’ headbands are flat and upright, and
generally sewn with green silk or red and green silk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
He was fond of brilliant doublures, sometimes all gold,
sometimes vellum edged with richly gilt morocco, and he
was also fond of gilded edges richly tooled.</p>

<p>In the nineteenth century we have in England produced
one binder who will probably in due time rank with the
highest. The work of Mr. T. J. Cobden-Sanderson will bear
comparison with the best work the past can show, either as
to general design or beauty of detail. Most of the good art
binding done now owes its inspiration to Mr. Cobden-Sanderson,
and already many of his pupils and followers
have achieved distinction for themselves; one of the best
of these is Mr. Douglas Cockerell. The rare work done by
Sir Edward Sullivan will also live. He is entirely original
in his work and in his manner of decoration.</p>

<p>Lady bookbinders in England have also done excellent
and beautiful work, particularly Miss E. M. MacColl, Miss
Sarah Prideaux, and Miss N. E. Woolrich.</p>

<p>Professional work of high excellence has been done in
recent years in England by Messrs. Bedford, Rivière, Zaehnsdorf,
and Morell. The younger Zaehnsdorf, G. Sutcliffe,
F. Sangorsky, Fazakerly of Liverpool, and A. De Santy
are all reliable, and may be trusted to produce work not
only technically perfect, but also charmingly finished and
admirably designed.</p>

<p>Compared, however, to modern French professional bookbinding
of the first rank, by Capé, Duru, Lortic, Bauzonnet,
and the rest, I find that there is a certain heaviness in
English forwarding&mdash;English binders have always liked
heavy boards; but I think that in the matter of gold tooling
our best modern finishers can hold their own safely.</p>

<p>Bookbinding has been more fostered and looked after in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
France than in any other country. As early as 1401 a
guild of all persons concerned in book production was
founded by charter from Charles VI., and continued, with
some changes, until 1791.</p>

<p>The chief change in this guild took place in 1686, when
the binding and gilding were treated as separate arts, as,
indeed, they properly are. From the time of Francis I.
until about 1633 we find that nearly all the Kings of France
had official binders, and, as might be expected, the best
French work is to be among their work, with the exception
of that of Le Gascon, who, like our Roger Payne, was never
favoured with Court patronage.</p>

<p>Heraldry plays a considerable part in English bookbinding,
but not so remarkable a one as it does in French bookbinding.
From royal books downwards, persons of distinction,
ecclesiastics of all ranks, ladies and private
persons, all liked to have their books ornamented with
their coats-of-arms as a principal ornament.</p>

<p>Etienne Roffet was Royal binder to Francis I., but I do
not feel sure that any binding of his is known. It may be,
however, considered likely that he bound most of the books
bearing the King’s crowned initials and his device of a
salamander.</p>

<p>Several of Jean Grolier’s books were bound by French
workmen. These are in the main designed on similar lines
to those bound by Italians, but there is a difference in the
details of the stamps used. One constant difference may
be found in the fact that on the Italian books the small
leaves and devices are <em>solid</em>, and on the French ones they
are <em>azured</em>, or scored across with fine lines. Some of the
French bound books have colour added on the fillets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>Geoffrey Tory lived well into the sixteenth century, and
among other artistic productions he designed a special
stamp for gilding his bindings with. Tory lost his only
little daughter, and
afterwards adopted as
his device a broken
vase, symbolic of his
broken life. This vase
is sometimes pierced
by a “toret,” probably
a play upon his own
name, as he describes
it: “ung vase antique
qui est cassé par lequel
passe ung toret.” The
book stamps do not
show the toret, but
the vase is there. In
the other ornamentation
and on these Tory
bindings is a strong
Italian feeling. It is
sure enough that the
art of gold tooling reached France by way of Venice, just
as it did England.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 121.</span>&mdash;French coloured and gold
tooled binding, with portrait of Henri II.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The most gorgeous period of French bookbinding was
that of Henri II. and his children. Henri himself loved fine
bindings, and so did Catherine de Medici, but unfortunately
we do not know who executed them. They are in calf or
morocco, and nearly always have coloured fillets. Those which
were bound for Diane de Poictiers, Duchesse de Valentinois,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
are equally remarkable, and all of them have, as a rule,
heraldic ornamentation. A fine portrait cameo stamp, however,
of Henri II. appears as a centrepiece on some of his
bindings, and the name Dianne appears on one of Diane’s
now in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 122.</span>&mdash;French sixteenth century binding,
made for Diane de Poictiers.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The cyphers which appear on all these bindings are as a
rule straightforward enough, being either those of Henri or
his Queen Catherine, but among them is one which contains
the initials H. and D. intertwined. This may mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
“Henri Dauphin,” but it is usually interpreted as meaning
“Henri” and “Diane.” I do not propose here to enter
into the vexed question of this curious cypher, as it has
already been fully discussed elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> but I may say that
Henri’s own device before he succeeded to the throne was a
crescent with the legend <span class="smcap">Nec impleat totem orbem</span>. An
unstrung bow as well as the
other emblems of Diana
the huntress undoubtedly
appears on bindings made
for this king. I am rather
inclined to think that these
devices of bow, crescents,
and quiver, which show on
the bindings made for
Henri as well as on those
made for Diane de Poictiers,
may really have been
separately chosen, and
have no necessary connection
with each other. On
the bindings made for
Diane de Poictiers the bow
is strung.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 123.</span>&mdash;French binding by Nicholas
Eve, 1578. Made for Henri III.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Henri III. was an eccentric
king, and it has been said that among other arts he learnt
that of bookbinding. He lost his ladylove, and ever afterwards
grieved her loss. His bindings show the device of the
confraternity of the White Monks, to which order he belonged,
and a skull and “<span class="smcap">Spes mea deus</span>.” But besides these gloomy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
bindings we owe some of the finest bindings ever made in
France to the art of Henri’s royal binder, Nicholas Eve.</p>

<p>The French order of St. Michel was founded by Louis
XI., in 1466, in place of an older order “De l’Etoile,”
which had been instituted by Jean II. Henri III., in 1578,
founded a new order, the Saint Esprit, and among the
State papers of the time is a note to the effect that Nicholas
Eve bound forty-two copies of the
<cite>Ordonnances de l’ordre du Sainct
Esprit</cite> for the king. One of these
books is now in the British Museum.
It is bound, as described in the official
note, in orange morocco, and agrees
in all respects with that description.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_236.jpg" width="200" height="307" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 124.</span>&mdash;French, gold
tooled “Fanfare”
binding. Made for
J. A. De Thou.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A remarkable style, known as “à
la Fanfare,” became common in
France about the end of the sixteenth
century. They are generally attributed
to Clovis Eve, who was Relieur
du Roy (1596), but there is really no
authority for such attribution. The
style is a beautiful one, and consists
of interlaced fillets enclosing graceful
sprays of laurel or palm, and arabesque curves. Some
of the finest examples were bound for J. A. de Thou, the
historian, and bear his arms, a chevron between three
gadflies, as a centre ornament.</p>

<p>Most of De Thou’s books are bound in morocco, and
among those which were made during the life of his second
wife Gasparde de la Chastre are some that are curiously
ornamented. They are bound in pale yellow morocco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
which has been stamped all over with impressions in black
outline, probably from a wood block, in floral or conventional
designs. The designs have afterwards been filled in by
hand with colour stains, green, red and blue. The leather
has been cut for the binding without any notice being taken
of the coloured designs, which consequently appear
irregularly on the finished work. The books are finished
with gold lines and the arms of De Thou and La Chastre
side by side.</p>

<p>It has been said that De Thou chose certain colours for
certain subjects, for the bindings of his books, but although
it may be so in some cases I do not think it is consistently
carried out.</p>

<p>Certain colours have no doubt been chosen in some cases
as distinctive of ownership, as for instance in the libraries
of the three daughters of Louis XV., all of whom bore the
same coat-of-arms. The books belonging to Madame
Victoire were bound in olive, those of Madame Adelaide in
red, and those of Madame Sophie in citron.</p>

<p>French bindings in morocco were sometimes stained
with colour, especially about the time of Henri II., but
colour on morocco is more generally added as a pigment.</p>

<p>In recent times some very decorative Spanish moroccos
have been curiously stained with a sort of marbling. Large
consignments of these coloured moroccos have been
imported into this country, and they have been used
especially by Mr. Roger De Coverly, one of our foremost
bookbinders. The morocco is not of a very good quality,
and it is too early to say whether the stains are harmful
to the leather, as they probably would be if they were
on calf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>Colour as indicating subject is usually given in the case
of large libraries that do their own binding. Red commonly
indicates history and art; blue, theology; green, agriculture
and botany; and so on.</p>

<p>In the early seventeenth century the mysterious “Le
Gascon” invented the “pointillé” or dotted style of gold
tooling, which has been more universally copied than any
other small peculiarity in book finishing.</p>

<div id="Ref_238fp" class="figcenter" style="width: 504px;">

<div class="caption"><p>French Seventeenth Century Binding. Inlaid and Gold Tooled.
By Le Gascon. [<em>To face p.</em> 238.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Le Gascon was supreme in the binding of small books,
whether ornamented with interlaced fillets, inlaid, or with
the curious design of a swollen cross. Le Gascon’s small
pointillé curves are most cleverly designed; two or three of
them suffice to cover a considerable space with an apparently
complicated design. The glittering effect of the small
pointillé work massed together is heightened by the free
addition of small golden dots wherever space can be found
for them.</p>

<p>Red morocco was Le Gascon’s favourite groundwork,
and on this he frequently set inlays of coloured morocco,
citron, olive and marbled brown. These were mostly used
in the case of bindings bearing a design of interlacing
fillets, with gold tooling between them. No signed binding
by Le Gascon is as yet known, but there are some bearing
the name of Florimond Badier, who was son-in-law to Jean
Gillède, which nearly resemble Le Gascon’s work, but lack
his exquisite finish. On some of these appears a small
dotted profile head, which is supposed to be a mark of
Le Gascon’s. This same head is copied on some of the
bindings of our English Samuel Mearne, who must therefore
have seen and admired some of Le Gascon’s or Badier’s
work. “Le Gascon” was probably Jean Gillède.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Macè Ruette followed many of Le Gascon’s manners, and
his son Antoine did the same. These binders were royal
binders to Louis XIII. and Louis XIV. respectively, and
probably bound most of the fine bindings made for these
kings, bearing their coats-of-arms.</p>

<p>The bindings made for the Baron de Longepierre are
not uncommon. They were probably bound by Luc
Antoine Boyet, royal binder to Louis XV. These little books
bear upon them the device of a golden fleece, because the
Baron wrote plays, and the only successful one was called
“Medea” and dealt with the subject of the Argonauts.
The bindings are all exquisitely finished, and of beautiful
red leather; they sometimes have finely decorated doublures
and marbling under the gold on the edges, a charming
detail which has been much liked by French binders ever
since.</p>

<p>Padeloup le Jeune was royal binder to Louis XV. after
Boyet, and belonged to one of the many French families of
binders. Padeloup’s work is luckily often signed by means
of a small ticket on the title page or end paper. He
perfected the patterns known as “Dentelles,” which had
been first thought of by Boyet. These designs start from
the edges of the boards inwards, and the inner edge is
deeply dentated and is supposed to resemble lace. Padeloup
used blue and red morocco, and executed several small
bindings with inlays of coloured leather in geometrical
designs.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Padeloup made several large bindings, and his stamps
are often large and boldly cut, but his successors gradually
fined his style down until the original bold indented work
became quite small and lace-like in itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>The liking for inlaid work which was started by Padeloup
rapidly grew, and it caused a certain deterioration in the
taste of French binding because it gave such scope for
minute technical skill that this soon became more sought
after than the power of fine designing. The skill shown
on inlaid bindings by Jean le Monnier, for instance, is
astonishing, but the designs on all his bindings are weak.
The same may be said of the work of J. A. Derôme. But
the work of both these binders is much sought after and
esteemed by many collectors.</p>

<p>Derôme le Jeune was the most important French binder
of the late eighteenth century. He took Padeloup’s large
“dentelles” and altered them so much that he at last
evolved a style of his own from them. Derôme drew the
whole design out in a much smaller and more delicate way,
and always put in some bird figures, and these designs are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
known as “Dentelles a l’oiseau.” He used citron, olive
and red morocco. Derôme has not a good reputation as a
forwarder; he is said to have cropped his books badly, and
also to have “sawn in” his bands so as to get flat or open
backs. Even so, he did not invent “sawn in” bands, as
that vice was practised in England a hundred years before
Derôme’s time, in the case of embroidered books; but the
fact of these two mannerisms having been noticed in the
work of this great binder only shows that the same faults
were probably universally prevalent at the time.</p>

<p>Modern French work is astonishing for its technical skill.
The work of Capé, Duru, Thouvenin, Bauzonnet, Trautz,
Lortic, Niedrée, Marius-Michel, Chambolle, and many
others is admirable from all workmanlike points of view.</p>

<p>But there is no genius in any of it; a great French
binder of this century is yet to come.</p>

<p>Spanish bindings are often very handsomely gold tooled,
and are usually ornamented with heraldic designs. Little
is known at present about them, but it is certainly doubtful
whether any great school of gold tooling in bindings has
ever existed outside Italy, England or France.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
